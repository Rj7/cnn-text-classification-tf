"sourdough raft race river festival yegventures transcript for the deaf , hard of hearing , and other special needs i went to see the sourdough river festival for the first time this year with our parkland and stunning river valley , i do n't know why i 've never taken a look at the festival here in river city when i showed up to the launch site a day early on my own mistake , i had the pleasure of speaking with one of the organizers hi , my name is kira dlusskaya and i'm the event organizer this year for sourdough raft race association 's river festival we will have a canoe race , we hae a two person raft race that anyone is welcome to enter as well , and then we 've got a big raft race as well so the rafts there are pretty large they can hold up to 12 people or so and they usually put a lot of effort into decorating them and it 's always a really good fun time it 's a water fight as well so all the rafts are equipped with water guns , pumps , and things like that it gets really fun especially on a hot day like this among those large entries was thrft raft , a raft made completely from crowdsourcing the raft is built by alex lakusta and he explains the story behind the media headliner this year we were talking about doing a raft last year and we got married last year and bought a house we did n't have any have any money to do it , and we did n't have any time to do it so this year when they postponed it a month , i went on kijiji looking for barrels 'cause i figured that 's the best place to get them and i saw that there was a bunch of plywood in place and everything so i just figured , what the hell , why not just do it all for free how much do you think all of this material would normally cost \? it 's a few hundred bucks i'm sure it 's probably 80 bucks worth of straps and whatever you can get the barrels for we have a 170 pump in my garage that does n't work how many hours \? 20 25 \? that 's it \? it did n't take very long once we got going once you build the deck i notice you have a make something edmonton logo on it yeah one of the guys behind make something edmonton chris labossiere , he was nice enough to give the entry fee if we put the logo on actually the other parts of this front used to have his name on it the thriftraft was so popular that it had its own twitter hashtag and ended up winning the titanic award and best 1st entry this year back to the event , kiera tells us about the river fest the event started in 1960 with the first crew going down from edmonton power and they thought , what 's a fun thing to do in edmonton \? so they decided to start off in devon back then they built rafts from logs on site and they had a big party they entry fee was a bottle of whiskey that was back then and it 's changed a lot the name sourdough has very little to do with the bread it 's called sourdough because the prospectors used to come out to this general area during the klondike times and they would always have a little bit of sourdough with them so then people would call them sourdoughs and they had rafts going up and down the river , so i think that 's where they got the inspiration from for the large raft race , it 's not a timed race per se it 's more judged based on the construction of the raft , and team spirit , and how much fun you have out there it usually gets down to rafters landing at around 3 to 3 30 we do however , give out the titanic award to whoever crashes first cause we do have something like that once in a while we do have safety personnel on staff on the river , and everybody 's safe even at that time while the river fest in mid august this year due to the alberta floods , next year 's 55th annual river fest will return to its usual slot during the k days it was a raft it looked good on paper if you like what you see , do n't forget to like and subscribe for more content ! lincoln ho raft race river valley sourdough river rafting water fight north saskatchewan river \( body of water \) edmonton make something yeg festival 54th 2013 2014 k days rafters landing terwillegar park canoe barrel water cannon rafting \( sport \) sourdough river raft association abflood dragon boat louise mckinney park edmonton queen riverboat alex lakusta chris labossiere kira dlusskaya",0.0
