spearfishing lake deifenbaker partial video of some of my spearfishing trips to lake deifenbaker saskatchewan, due to incredibly frustrating uploading issues, including constant uploading aborts, and upload rates of slower 80min/min of video i have given up on uploading the rest of this vid for the moment, unfortunately i was unable to include any fish footage. visiblity was quite poor and generally less than six feet,mid season it was very good but due to work commitments i was unable to make it to the lake.  when the water cools down a bit i hope to get some action that is worth the effort of uploading. spearfishing lake diefenbaker spearfishing for trout spearfishing for goldeye spearfishing for walleye spearfishing

algonquin spring trout fishing   day 4   ralph bice lake to magnetawan lake you can find the written trip report along with a lot more pictures at:   we woke up on the final day of our spring fishing trip to find a small trace of snow on the ground. if only we had known what was in store for us the rest of the day. this was one of the few days that i haven't fished on our spring canoe trip. the wind was just too much to make it worthwhile even trying to fish.   this was also the day that my canon sx30is camera died from the combination of being too wet and too cold. that camera took a lot of abuse from me, but it's a lesson learned to take a bit better care of it in the future. (yes i had it repaired). i was able to finish recording the trip with my older sx10is but the last few segments of video aren't hd as a result.   i have to give the kids full credit again for handling the trip out with a lot of skill, zero complaints and even some big smiles. algonquin provincial park (protected site) ralph bice lake hambone lake magnetawan lake canoeing in the snow canoeing (sport) canoe trip spring canoe trip spring (risk factor)

cod fishing, pines cove, newfoundland and labrador there is no better way to reconnect with (or discover) your newfoundland and labrador heritage than by spending a day on the salt water. we did this with ronan and cormac by taking them out fishing for cod during the recreational cod season. this was their first time on salt water and we lucked out with a perfectly calm day. the lads were more than excited when they caught their first codfish and became "official newfoundlanders" j we put the boat ashore on green island and found two gull chicks. while on the island we also watched dolphins just off the shore. this should be a day that they will remember forever. recreational cod fishery cod jigging cod fishing newfoundland newfoundland and labrador pines cove green island cove green island dolphins peter bull gull chicks gulls

fly fishing birkenhead river in pemberton british columbia fly fishing birkenhead river in pemberton british columbia.  the birkenhead river holds some of the best fly fishing in british columbia, canada and the world.  during the month of may the river has a heavy influence of spring run off.  the spring run off is caused by the melting snow in the mountains.  this keeps the water very cold, well oxygenated and it also washes a ton of feed into the water.  feed in the form of black ants, stonefly nymphs and case caddis.  during the month of may expect to catch rainbow trout, coastal cutthroat trout, whitefish and bull trout.  although the main stem of the birkenhead river is very high and swift, it will hold fish.  what we have found to be a much safer alternative to fishing the main stem is fishing the side channels.  the side channels branch off into much smaller, less swift, wadeable sections that carry a ton of structure.  structure that hosts great hiding for salmon fry and a wide variety of aquatic nymphs.  the month of may also triggers great dry fly fishing.  the days become much longer and warmer.  we have found that as soon as the sun sets behind the mountains in the evenings, the birkenhead river comes to life with many hatches.  hatches that include sedges, black gnats, caddis and of course the mayfly.  the birkenhead river is located 15 minutes north of pemberton on portage road.  follow the signs north toward the village of d'arcy once you leave pemberton.  the river is well marked on the bridge that crosses it.  once you cross the bridge the birkenhead river is on your left, pretty well anywhere you see a pull out there is a trail that will take you down to the river.  we always recommend that you carry bear spray while fishing the birkenhead river because it is common to run into bears throughout the day.  although there has never been a recorded bear attack on the river, bear spray is an inexpensive piece of mind.  bear spray and all of your fly fishing needs are available at spud valley sporting goods ltd. in pemberton, bc at 1380 birch street.  spud is well stocked with all of your fishing needs, they have a great map on the counter and their staff can help you pick out some flies for fly fishing that are working. if you would like to get on the fast track to catching fish on the birkenhead river the pemberton fish finder offers 3 fishing tours varying length.  a 3 hour introductory fly fishing tour, a 5 hour "half day" and an 8 hour "full day" fishing tour.  our full day tour includes a tasty shore lunch.  visit our website for more information about our fly fishing tours, rates and information about our professional fishing guides. we look forward to fishing with you, pemberton fish finder   below we have included a short fly fishing video and some pictures of trout from the birkenhead river.  the fly fishing video was filmed may 5th, 2016.  enjoy, share and visit us on facebook! fly fishing birkenhead river in pemberton british columbia best fly fishing in british columbia fly fishing in may rainbow trout coastal cutthroat trout bull trout birkenhead river fly fishing spud valley sporting goods ltd fly fishing in pemberton british columbia canada professional fishing guides pemberton fish finder best fly fishing in british columbia canada fly fishing canada

rapala cruzer m2 portable ice fishing shelter assembly - quinte ice fishing team the quinte ice fishing team is excited to be running a fleet of the new rapala cruzer portable ice fishing shelters this winter.  with our "run and gun" style of fishing, these new shelters are the perfect fit.  here is a video of us assembling one of the rapala cruzer m2, two person shelters.  a mobile approach to hardwater angling can greatly increase your winter success.  while fishing from shore or boat, anglers rarely cast to or sit in a static position for very long, so why do we do this come winter?  keep moving, cover water and stay on fish! this season rapala introduces the rapshack cruzer series of premium ice shelters.  aptly named, these two flip-over style models provide the utmost in mobility, comfort and functionality.  a shelter that is easily set up by one person and ready to fish in sixty seconds while being protected from all weather conditions is fundamental to a serious ice angler's approach.  both available options, including a one-person and two-person model were designed with a combined focus on quality and durability in construction, while keeping weight at a minimum.  the sideways sled orientation provides increased fishable area along with enough headroom for unrestricted hook sets.  the tent consists of a quality, double stitched 300 denier fabric with reinforced corners and reflective trim for night safety and a large skirt for wind resistance.  three removable windows via velcro fasteners offer light and the ability to keep an eye outside, yet can be covered to darken the inside when sight fishing.  it also features a mesh storage pocket, an extra-large door with ykk zippers, and a safety ventilation system to prevent moisture build-up and co2 exposure. the sled design is light & compact and features an oversized padded seat.  for those nicer days when a wind-block is all that you need, a special lock mechanism can be used to hold the tent in an up-right position. the one-man model also features a storage shelf.  complete this versatile ice fishing platform with additional accessories: the rapshack cruzer slider kit which aids in tracking straighter and pulls easier due to reduced friction. the rapshack cruzer travel cover and rapshack tow bar/hitch are essential components for anglers towing behind an atv or snowmobile. beyond mobility, this style of shelter provides a method to store and transport your gear to your favourite ice fishing destination. stay mobile, and catch more fish with the rapala rapshack cruzer series of shelters and accessories this winter. fishing ice rapala cruzer cruzer m2 portable shelter ice fishing bay of quinte quinte ice fishing team hut hardwater assemble

bosko  ain't nature grand! 1931  leon schlesinger bosko goes fishing next to a no fishing sign. he feels sorry for the worm he's brought; instead he uses the letters on the sign to act as worms. he catches a fish, declares it cute and pets it. the fish spits at him and jumps back into the water. meanwhile, the worm is not safe yet. a bird chases him; but he escapes into a hole. we're back to bosko who finds two ladybugs dancing on stones next to a waterfall as a spider plays his web as a harp. a pelican rises up from the water to deposit four frogs next to bosko. bosko and the frogs sing and dance. the two ladybugs are mischievous; they use a wasp as an airplane, a flower as a propeller, and a beehive and tree branch as a machine gun. they shoot bosko with bees, driving him away and into a water fountain. but the happy bosko tips his hat to the audience to show he's all right.  classic cartoons from the early 20th century until about 1950,  and classical music, early jazz and blues, some mountain music and children's tunes.  everything here is child safe and child approved.  we have just about every animated movie short there is available on the internet.  they come from depatie-freleng and all their friends including pink panther, ant and the aardvark, looney tunes, the inspector and merrie melodies.  there's fable studios, harvey entertainment, henson studios,  hugh harmon productions, ub iwerks studios, chuck jones, van beuren, united artists, columbia, walt disney studios, famous studios, filmation studios, fleischer studios, fox studios, hanna-barbera,  mgm studios, paramount studios, universal studios and warner bros. studios. characters??  there are all to many to list here and do them any justice.  if you can think of a character that has its origins in american animation history, we either have it or we can find it.  some cartoon videos are gone forever, however, many that have that same character in a staring role are available.  all you have to do is drop us a line, and we will do our best to locate it.    so, like, subscribe and follow us and we will keep you up with things that are better than tv.    andythebeagle. bosko frog fishing no fishing sign water fountain cartoon dog whistling cartoon frog cartoon insect cartoon worm leon schlesinger classic cartoons spider harp
