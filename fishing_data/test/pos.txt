Crazy Canucks Ice Fishing Monster Spring WalleyeOut Ice fishing Spring Walleye and my Crazy Canadian Brother felt a little over dressed for the weather.   It was a beautiful day and we were hauling up some beautiful walleye on the Slender Spoon with the help of a MarCum.  Saw people moving around all day which usually means they weren't finding the fish.  We drilled many holes over a single underwater point and found the depth the fish were holding at rather than changing spots.  It worked out well for us.  More holes = More Fish.  Get your drill on!
Rainbow Trout Underwater Ice Fishing GoPro HeroThe fish are not always where you expect to find them.  This day I noticed I wasn't getting any bites near the bottom and I saw a lot of aquatic bugs right under the ice.  So I started to jig right under the ice over ten feet of water and looked down the hole.  To my surprise fish were swimming right under my hole checking out the bait and even striking at it once in a while.  This was pretty cool so I drilled a couple of holes and stuck my GoPro Down to see what I could catch.  There was lots of snow on ice and this was late in the day so the lighting isn't the best but still pretty interesting to see their near ice behavior in the winter.  The ones I caught and filleted were full of these water bugs and sticklebacks.Title Created with www.flixpress.comYoutube Creation Tools Audio Library song: "The Wrong Time"
Best Rainbow Trout Ice fishing TIPS with Jaw JackerFishing Hermitage Park Pond for Rainbow Trout under the ice is always something I like to try when home for Christmas.  This is late in the season for these rainbows and sometimes they aren't very active as the oxygen levels in the lake fall.  I got out to the lake around sunrise although it was cloudy so I didn't see it.  I wasn't getting any hits in a usual spot so I moved across the pond to another spot.  Right around noon I had the first hit on the Jaw Jacker and lost him at the hole.  Lowered back down and soon had a nice 16 inch rainbow.  I underestimated in the video at 14 inches.  After that the bites were on and off.  But must have had 15 fish on the line and hits on the Jaw Jacker but only ended up getting four on the ice.  It was a lot of fun.  Check out the video for all the details and how you can catch more fish at Hermitage Park pond.  Get out there before they winterkill.  The action was fast and furious in the afternoon.
Water Proof Samsung Galaxy S5 Survives Extreme Underwater ConditionsSamsung Galaxy S5 Phone rescued after I dropped it through a hole in the ice while fishing into 20 feet of water.  The phone was dropped in around 3 pm and spent the night on the lake bottom.  The next morning we arrived with all sort of poles and nets to retrieve the phone.  After 2 hours of trying we were able to net the phone.  After sitting in the ice cold water for 21 hours not only was the phone still on it had 74% battery life.  This was an epic rescue and catch.  We were pretty excited to have actually retrieved the phone and even more excited that it was still working.  If you're a fisherman and prone to dropping things in the water you may want to look into getting and S5.  Mine has survived two water submersion and my wifes has survived being dropped in the lake as well.
GoPro Hero Black 3+ Underwater Perch FishingGoPro Hero 3+ Black Underwater camera set up to film the Jaw Jacker.  I didn't realize it had been set off earlier and this is what resulted underwater during that time.  I'm amazed how clear this Hero 3+ is.  Really spectacular images in HD.  Too bad there weren't a few more perch around that were interested in biting this day.  It was fun to watch them chase the minnows around anyways.

I was hopeful that it would be working but wasn't sure if we could retrieve it.  With the help of two Aqua Vu cameras we were able to locate the phone. Punched a whole bunch of holes with the Eskimo auger.  Rigged some 24 foot long poles and went to work to get the phone from the bottom of the lake.  When It came out it was fully functional with 74% battery life after 21 hours under the ice!

Understanding Walleye Underwater Behavior Ice Fishing the Jaw JackerUnderwater Walleye Behavior while ice fishing using a Jaw Jacker.  To get this video I just sent a GoPro down to watch what would go on  while I had a Jaw Jacker set up.  This was a super slow day.  So much so we didn't think there were many fish around.  That was until I reviewed the footage and saw many fish swim by without even giving notice to the bait.  Then there were those that would just come in for a look and others that would just nudge the bait.  Finally did get one to inhale the bait on the Jaw Jacker.  Learned a very important lesson that on these slow neutral days a minnow on the bottom was more likely to attract a bit.  So the next  trip my uncle headed out with a jig and minnow, then a few inches of line and a single hook below.  Attach a minnow to both and send down.  Let the bottom minnow lay on the bottom.  The next time he went out the fish were in a similar mood, but the jaw jacker caught 90% of the fish and all of them were on that bottom minnow on the bottom.  So this really is a highly effective method of Jaw Jacker fishing for walleye especially on those tough days. Give it a try and don't forget to comment below, LIKE and SUBSCRIBE!
Hands on AnglingLuc and Tim at the end of the season on last ice, doing some "Hands On Angling".

Shocking Underwater Jaw Jacker Northern Pike Friday the 13thUnderwater Video of the Jaw Jacker in action on a very tough day of fishing March Friday the 13th.  The weather was beautiful warm, calm and sunny but the fish were in an ultra negative mood.  So much so we thought there weren't any fish in the area from watching our MarCum.  Turns out there were lots of fish in our area and instead of our jigging action pulling fish in to the bait it was actually turning them off before they were even seen on the  sonar.  This is where the Jaw Jacker's were excelling.  I learned a few things from this video.  The pike were getting off because I had a light line on the rod and reel so I think the monofilament was stretching too much to get a good hook set.  Also since the fish were in such a negative mood they wouldn't even fight after the hook set so they would create their own slack and just spit the hook.  So on slow days it really does call for a Jaw Jacker rigged with braided line, a good stiff rod and loaded with lots of tension.  That way the fish will hopefully still be there when you get to the rod on those slow fishing days.  Check out the video I learned a lot from watching it after and hope you do too.

We even were blessed with the haunting call of a Loon or two ... one of the most incredible sounds to hear. If you haven't fished the Adirondacks, now is the time!

Stopped by my friend's private Trout Pond for a try at "Drone Fishing" or "Phantom Fishing" with my DJI Phantom 3 Pro Multi-Rotor "Flying Camera".The fish were more cautious than I thought they would be as I believe the Flying UAV overhead probably resembled the Ospreys and Eagles that take shots at them from time to time.There was a certain amount of risk in not knowing if the Phantom could lift even the smallest fish at 12+ inches.  Even more risky was the fact that there were some 5 and 8 pound hold-over "Lunkers" in the pond too..  The first good strike was from a medium sized Trout that yanked the line and bobber right out of the "Safety" clip.  There was a very real possibility that I would have to dive in the pond to save the Phantom as there were no boats that could be used to save the Phantom if I hooked "Troutzilla".I searched for other Drone Fishing videos but could only find several with a minnow that looked like it was already dead and a few with palm sized or smaller Sunfish, Bluegills or similar fish that seem to give up when you lift them out of the water..  I wanted to see some REAL fishing with fish that you would actually consider having for dinner...  Fish that could FIGHT BACK !! :-)

Maumee River Walleye Run 2015This video is some of the fish that I caught at the walleye run this year (2015). I was only able to fish 4/11 and 4/12. I had a blast catching them even though you snag them way more than you catch legal. I went with a great group of guys. You also meet some pretty friendly people while in the water. My biggest was just under 6 pounds. My brother pulled out a jack that was just over 7. In total the group caught 22 keepers. I was using a Abu Ora Sx spinning real along with a Shimano Crucial Medium fast rod.

Belwood Lake FishingLike to find where to fish? I mean a good one, try fish at Belwood lake. Belwood Lake is located at 8282 Wellington County Rd. 18, RR #4, Fergus, ON N1M 2W5. It was created in 1942 with the construction of the Shand Dam, the first dam in Canada built solely for water control purposes. Conservation area visitors can stand on the top deck of the dam and see the vista of the Grand River valley below. A stairway along the face of the dam allows visitors to walk down to its base. The flow from the dam is used to generate hydroelectricity. The 12 km-long lake (7.5 miles) offers excellent boating, fishing and water-skiing, while a small spring-fed quarry offers an ideal spot for people to cool off on hot summer days.Enjoy your Belwood lake fishing!

Killer Spinner Rig Searching for Perch and WalleyeWhen you're at a new lake and don't really know where to begin it is a good idea to go with trolling.  You cover ground with a very effective presentation searching for active fish on the prowl.  One of my favorite methods to troll or drift with the wind is using a bottom bouncer and spinner rig. Most conventional spinner rigs have on spinner with some beads and a float.  We've taken it another step to create the killer rig with three large spinner blades and multiple floats.  For some reason the perch love this set up as well as Big walleye.  So if you've never used a spinner rig bottom bouncing before this video is for you.
How to use Berkley Gulp Trout Dough and Powerbait Trout FishingHow to use Berkley Gulp Trout Dough and Powerbait Trout Fishing.How to use Berkley Gulp Trout Dough and Powerbait Trout Fishing.How to use Berkley Gulp Trout Dough and Powerbait Trout Fishing.How to use Berkley Gulp Trout Dough and Powerbait Trout Fishing.How to use Berkley Gulp Trout Dough and Powerbait Trout Fishing.On of the most consistent way to catch a meal of rainbow trout from a stocked pond is to use floating dough baits for trout.  I prefer to use the Berkley products Powerbait and Gulp Trout Dough.  Both of these baits float well and produce a lot of fish.  My all round favorite tested in several lakes seems to be Gulp Chunky Cheese in Garlic scent or flavor.  The trout go crazy after this bait and if presented well you will be into some great fishing.  You will need a 3/8 oz sliding egg sinker, a barrel swivel, 4 pound Berkley Vanish fluorocarbon line and a size 18 treble hook.  Very the leader length from 12 inches to 4 feet for best results.  I usually start with a leader around 18 inches long.  Roll up a ball of bait and cover the treble hook.  Then launch it out into the water gently so not to lose the bait.  Then the waiting begins and if everything is right with fish in the area you wont have long to wait.  So go catch some rainbow trout today at a local pond or lake and give this set up a try.

The Return Of The Salmon 2016The Return Of The Salmon: An Award-winning DocumentaryFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/returnofthesalmonWebsite: http://www.returnofthesalmon.comEach summer, millions of salmon conclude their lifelong odyssey in Alaskan rivers. It is salmon that bring life to their natal streams. While swimming upstream, they stop feeding. From the forest to the animals that live there, salmon provide essential nutrients and food. Many species harvest the seasonal bounty, including bears, wolves, eagles and ravens. This is a journey no salmon survive, for once they have spawned, they die. Each year we catch millions of salmon from the Tongass National Forest in Southeast Alaska. Salmon support thousands of Alaskan livelihoods. They are central to the Alaskan way of life. Salmon are the lifeblood of Alaska.Alaskan cruise tourists can choose wildlife watching as a cruise excursion when they come ashore. Watching bears catching salmon is one of the most popular things to do in Alaska for tourists. Most tourists take a cruise up the Inside Passage and disembark at the Southeast Alaska stops of Sitka, Juneau or Ketchikan. Tour operators offer popular brown bear viewing excursions to nearby "ABC" Islands. Admiralty, Baranof and Chichagof Islands are famous for their grizzly bear inhabitants. There is one animal that draws the most significant amount of tourists from the Lower 48 to Southeast Alaska.  Each summer thousands of fishermen make their pilgrimage to fish the rivers of the Tongass National Forest. The Pacific salmon returning from the ocean on their spawning migration are the catch of the day. Five species of Pacific salmon return to Alaska each summer: the pink or “humpy”, chum, coho, sockeye and Chinook. Each year commercial fishing fleets catch close to 50 million salmon. 120,000 sports fishermen catch 1 million salmon as they return to the rivers of Southeast Alaska. These statistics help us understand the significance of the salmon run to the local economy. Without the return of the salmon, one of nature's great events, Alaska would be a different place. During Tim Plowden's trip to the Alaska he realised it was all about the return of the salmon. He decided to create this short natural history documentary about the final stage of the salmon’s life cycle. Their migration to the waters of their birth to spawn is an epic story. A score composed and performed by Christel Veraart accompanies Tim Plowden’s footage. New narration in this 2016 version is by seasoned voice over professional Kevin O'Connell.Awards: "Best Of Alaska Award" 2015 Alaska International Film Awards; "Award of Merit"  2015 IndieFEST Film Awards.Official Selections:  2015 British Documentary Film Festival; 2015 International Kuala Lumpur Eco Film Festival; Voices from the Waters International Traveling Film Festival in India; and just announced - 2016 Wildlife Conservation Film Festival in New York!

EASY CATCH FISHING RODFor more information go to http://www.easycatchfishingrod.com(Full description below - click Show More)The easy catch rod does all the work!The combination of a spring loaded hinge and a balancing force provided by the indicator assembly enhances the efficiency of the fishing rod. The spring loaded hinge and the pivoting arm allow the fish to drag the bait downward.This allows the fish to pull the fishing line freely for a distance of approximately 1 foot, and when the arm member reaches the end of its range of movement, then the fish's pulling on the line draws the line taut which is usually enough to set the hook in the fish's mouth. The reflector tilts upward in unison with the folding of the arm into a near vertical orientation to indicate the likelihood that a fish has been caught. For typical ice fishing, a fishing line rated at 50 lb strength has been found to be suitable. Notice: For deep sea fishing a line of 80 to 100lb test is recommended.When the user is ready to pack up, he or she simply reels or winds the fishing line up and pushes down the arm member so that it folds against the mast. For even more compact storage, the indicator assembly can be removed. Advantageously, no tools are required for assembly or disassembly.For more information go to http://www.easycatchfishingrod.com

Great Lakes Ice Fishing, Lake Erie, Small Boat Harbor for PerchDoing a little ice fishing on 2/18/13 in the Small Boat Harbor at Buffalo, New York.  Air temp was 13 degrees in the morning increasing to about 30 degrees in the afternoon.  Skies were partly cloudy with 10mph wind.  The perch were hitting all day long, ranging from 6" to 10.25".  In this particular video, my dad misses on his first few hits but then catches two fish at the same time on the same line.  He uses a common setup consisting of two eagle claw hooks tied about 10" apart with a sinker on the bottom.  He balances his pole on a can so that he can see the fish hit.  The bait is emerald shiners purchased from Big Catch bait and tackle on Niagara Street.  We kept about 10 fish that day and fried them up for a nice little snack the following day.

Funny fishing stories.Fish attacks girl and she makes a scene. Who wins this fish vs. girl battle? who loses the fish attack? I took my 14 year old daughter to Michigan for the 4th of July weekend in 2010 and she decided she wanted to try fishing. The fish her cousin had caught was a whopping 2.5 inches and she was scared to death of this thing. She was freaking out when it flopped towards her, not only one time but twice.

FISHING RODFor more information go to  www.easycatchfishingrod.comThe easy catch rod does all the work!The combination of a spring loaded hinge and a balancing force provided by the indicator assembly enhances the efficiency of the fishing rod. The spring loaded hinge and the pivoting arm allow the fish to drag the bait downward.Thos allows the fish to pull the fishing line freely for a distance of approximately 1 foot, and when the arm member reaches the end of its range of movement, then the fish's pulling on the line draws the line taut which is usually enough to set the hook in the fish's mouth. The reflector tilts upward in unison with the folding of the arm into a near vertical orientation to indicate the likelihood that a fish has been caught. For typical ice fishing, a fishing line rated at 50 lb strength has been found to be suitable. Notice: For deep sea fishing a line of 80 to 100lb test is recommended.When the user is ready to pack up, he or she simply reels or winds the fishing line up and pushes down the arm member so that it folds against the mast. For even more compact storage, the indicator assembly can be removed. Advantageously, no tools are required for assembly or disassembly.For more information go to  www.easycatchfishingrod.com

There are thousands of these fish all over and they love just about anything you put in front of them but is best to use a jig head because the fish are very aggressive and using any type of lure with treble hooks they usually embed both hooks in them making it difficult to remove as they don't like to stay still when trying to remove the hooks.

Handmade 5 Layer Laminated Trout Fishing NetThis is a beautiful 5 layer Laminated trout fishing net that is just exquisite to look at.  It is functionable and most folks are buying them up and displaying them in their Den's.  The nets are made by Bill Spagnolo a local artisan here in St. Lawrence County New York.  Bill Spagnolo was born and raised in the North Country. Now retired, he spent 36 years working at Alcoa. His passions include gardening, photography, woodworking, and fishing. Indulging in his wildlife and nature photography, he captured beautiful photos of wood ducks, nature scenes, but mainly, white-tailed deer.As an established cabinet maker, he has built kitchen cabinets, antique replicas, and cedar canoes. An avid trout fisherman for 40 years, he ties his own flies. He has assisted the DEC in reclaiming lakes and ponds by reintroducing the native, Windfall strain of brook trout. Winter months he combined his passions by designing his own fishing net for canoes and float tubes. His new concept of fly fishing net combines materials and construction into a fully laminated (both handle and hoop) work of art with up to 5 laminates. He has experimented with numerous exotic and local woods for durability and beauty, such as, blood cherry, ash, red cherry, walnut, padauk, poplar, and hickory. When laminated properly, the contrast of woods make for a striking and uniquie fishing net which most customers prefer to simply mount in their dens, but are practical and durable for lake and pond fishing.

Throw it out let if fall and sit, then slowly snake it in trying to stop often to invade a bass personal space and he will hit it out of anger weather he's hungry or not.     " I practice good healthy catch and release."

Gary lands a beauty that Steve reeled in, and then passes it to him so that he can take a photo of Steve with his fish.  Sounds innocent enough but should inspire a smile.To see more original fishing wildlife and adventure videos:  youtube.com/stevemacinnis

Fishing for Cohos in Juneau, Alaska
Fly Fishing for Pink Salmon from a Row Boat5wt fly rod + row boat + lots of fish @ east side of Vancouver Island. Pink salmon are one of my absolute favorite fish to target. The fishing is always action-packed and the meat is choice. Keep your rod-tip low, retrieve short strips and when you feel the slightest resistance, raise the rod and it's game-on.Music By:The Green - What Will Be Will BeBalyhoo - Front PorchEase Up - Feelin' Irie
Easter Weekend Fishing in the Strait of GeorgiaLots of tasty flounder ended up in the icebox this past long weekend. Unfortunately, you can't keep lingcod here until May 1, so we had to let one go that probably would have been legal size. I'll be going back to the same spot after May 1 to see if I can find it again.Music By: Rage Against The Machine - Testify
