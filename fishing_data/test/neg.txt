BWCAW Sep 10-21, 2014, Fishing on Thumb Lake (39 of 113)I find a decent northern pike on Thumb Lake.  I think he was still relatively a youngster because you'll notice how big his head is and how it's disproportionate to the rest of his body.  I think he was but a teenager still in the "awkward stage".

First ATV Ride Out On The Lake - Dec. 7, 2014TEESPRING T-Shirt Campaign LINK:http://teespring.com/cubbeezxENDS Monday DECEMBER 15th!Finally got out for a ride....it's been awhile!! Took the Grizzly and Kodiak for a rip out on the lake. The ice appears to be anywhere from 10-18 inches thick already and it isn't even officially winter yet!  As usual the first winter ride we had a few technical difficulties with the camera and mic's but not too bad.If you like our videos, be sure to comment, share, thumbs up and subscribe!

Veloster on a Lake (ice and snow)Check out my Veloster videos, pictures and opinions at www.velosterlover.comI drove out to Gimli and could not resist taking my new Hyundai Veloster right out on to the ice of Lake Winnipeg.  The weather was sunny and and just below freezing,, perfect for ice fishing. I have always wanted to try ice racing and the Winnipeg Sports Car Club is scheduled to ice race on March 2,2012 at Gimli,, but I would have to buy a cheap used car for that.  Sorry there is no drifting,, there was way too much snow on the ice that I was likely to get stuck in the middle of the lake with no tow truck service.  Here are some pictures showing some of the setups I used make my Veloster videos.http://www.flickr.com/photos/74488050@N04/sets/72157629376880107/The music is a studio recording by Gord Houghton an indy artist from Winnipeg.  This track called "Biography" is from one of his bands "Symington Yard" I used with his WRITTEN permission in exchange for giving him credit here.  Gord is supremely talented and should be making a good living from music. Checkout this live open mic:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7P55Rmg6YI나는 김리로 가서는 호수 위니펙의 얼음에 금방 나가 나의 새로운 현대 Veloster를 복용 저항할 수 없었다.날씨가 얼음 낚시를위한 완벽한, 햇살이었고, 단 영하. 나는 항상 얼음 경주 체험을하고 싶어했으며 위니펙 스포츠 자동차 클럽은 김리 년 3 월 2,2012에 얼음 경주 예정되어 있습니다,하지만 난 그것에 대해 저렴한 중고차를 구매해야합니다.As of March 2013 its my second winter driving in Winnipeg, mainly city driving on all season tires.  Overall I'm impressed with the traction control and even driving pretty aggressively I have only lost control once by suddenly deciding to turn causing a sideways slid before recovering with no collision.  I had planned on buying winter tires by now, but money always ends up getting spent on something else.  If I was doing more highway winter driving I definitely would have bought them by now.  In deep snow I have been stuck, but even a police car got stuck on one of those days.  I keep a small shovel and used it twice each winter.  Some people will buy an SUV just thinking they are better in winter,, but they are no safer being so high,, hitting the ditch they are more likely to role and to me an SUV is just a taller station wagon.  SUVs, station wagons and minivans still make me cringe
The Lower Grand River Flooding at Fishmasters February 14th, 2009The water was flowing hard and fast overnight.  With an Ice Jam holding back the flow at Port Maitland, it didn't take long for the levels to rise... Thankfully we are high and dry however the water has taken over a better part of our driveway... Some on the river side of Dunnville and Broad Street didn't fare so well... Thanks go out to the fire and police departments for doing a great job and checking in on us on a regular basis!

Rapala Cruzer M2 Portable Ice Fishing Shelter Assembly - Quinte Ice Fishing TeamThe Quinte Ice Fishing Team is excited to be running a fleet of the new Rapala Cruzer portable ice fishing shelters this winter.  With our "run and gun" style of fishing, these new shelters are the perfect fit.  Here is a video of us assembling one of the Rapala Cruzer M2, two person shelters.A mobile approach to hardwater angling can greatly increase your winter success.  While fishing from shore or boat, anglers rarely cast to or sit in a static position for very long, so why do we do this come winter?  Keep moving, cover water and stay on fish! This season Rapala introduces the RapShack Cruzer series of premium ice shelters.  Aptly named, these two flip-over style models provide the utmost in mobility, comfort and functionality.A shelter that is easily set up by one person and ready to fish in sixty seconds while being protected from all weather conditions is fundamental to a serious ice angler's approach.  Both available options, including a one-person and two-person model were designed with a combined focus on quality and durability in construction, while keeping weight at a minimum.  The sideways sled orientation provides increased fishable area along with enough headroom for unrestricted hook sets.  The tent consists of a quality, double stitched 300 Denier fabric with reinforced corners and reflective trim for night safety and a large skirt for wind resistance.  Three removable windows via Velcro fasteners offer light and the ability to keep an eye outside, yet can be covered to darken the inside when sight fishing.  It also features a mesh storage pocket, an extra-large door with YKK zippers, and a safety ventilation system to prevent moisture build-up and CO2 exposure. The sled design is light & compact and features an oversized padded seat.  For those nicer days when a wind-block is all that you need, a special lock mechanism can be used to hold the tent in an up-right position. The one-man model also features a storage shelf.Complete this versatile ice fishing platform with additional accessories: The RapShack Cruzer Slider Kit which aids in tracking straighter and pulls easier due to reduced friction. The RapShack Cruzer Travel Cover and RapShack Tow Bar/Hitch are essential components for anglers towing behind an ATV or snowmobile. Beyond mobility, this style of shelter provides a method to store and transport your gear to your favourite ice fishing destination. Stay mobile, and catch more fish with the Rapala RapShack Cruzer series of shelters and accessories this winter.
ice driving subaru imprezaThis is how I warm up the car after ice fishing.  Driving my impreza outback sport on ice is a blast.  The ice is about 18 inches, and the water around 20 feet.  Large trucks are driving on the lake so I feel my little car should be fine.  The first thing to do when driving on ice is to roll down the windows and take off your seat belt.

Pulling an ATV out of lake Winnipeg that went through the ice2003 Arctic Cat 4x4 400cc Quading on Lake Winnipeg and broke through the ice. Quad floated upside down tires up exposed in the water. Lassoed the wheel and then the hitch.  Pulled it out using a combo of 4 recovery straps and a 10,000 pound winch mounted to the front of a 9000 pound Diesel Ford Excursion.Lesson learned. Even though the majority of the Lake was clear ice and 4ft thick. There was still thin ice.

UHC Season 7 - Episode 4: The Fishing NetworkWelcome back to the fishing network! Just kidding another UHC.Welcome to UHC Season 7! Minecraft: Ultra Hardcore is a gamemode originally created by Guude and the group Mindcrack. In UHC mode, health does not regenerate, you must use a golden apple or instant health potion. In addition, ghasts drop gold ingots, rather than ghast tears, so players cannot brew regeneration potions. In this season of UHC, we have 23 participants scattered across a 2500x2500 map playing solo using the Mumble plugin that adds directional audio in-game. The last remaining player is deemed the winner. The season was recorded in a single-session. We're using a custom plugin for UHC that automatically disables PvP for the first 20 minutes and displays episode timers. Custom plugin and hosting provided by Mineplex.com.

I love Fishing, Girl PowerMy name is Gina R. Cowins and I believe “Paint Emotions 4-A Cure” is the right medicine. I joined the struggle and started healing hearts by making easy transitions with colors and drawings.  We can defeat low concentration spans and temporary memory loss. Get involved today and make somebody happy.  My art share telepathy experiences into the twilight zone. I enjoy people who show their artistic abilities and create visual art.  I believe each stroke, line, and curvatures are dimensions of a door in a room. We open doors to enter and exit into our lives.

28 6 Cabin tour, dinner of dehydrated potatoes, salmon and a fishing story Petersburg AlaskaDuring our mid-August week long stay in Petersburg, Alaska the weather had been damp. They had just come out of a good stretch of sunny weather in the high 70's, it was in the mid to high fifties during our stay, and as I write now 10 days later Sept. 2, 2009, they are again having sunny days. There is a great web cam that refreshes every 15 seconds perched on the National Public Radio Station tower in town. KFSK radio can be search engined, click on the web cam. We began planning our vacation in May of 2009. If I did not get a daily fix of the KFSK webcam, something was wrong. Much history of the community is available on-line, Google Earth posters have left numerous photos of the community. Recently I read that a group of advisors arriving in town representing the travel industry were trying to emphasize the eco-tourism appeal of the region. The Panhandle of Alaska is as wet as any equatorial region frequented by monsoons. From some of the other movies we have posted you can see the lush nature of just this one island of which there are literally hundreds, most of them unpopulated except by wildlife.  Real Estate in the community is "By Owner", or through a local realty group named Petersburg Realty, what else? The owner of the boat rental told us he was soon selling out his boats, and would become the owner of the realty. Properties on the island ranged from undeveloped land accessible by foot through the underbrush, to undeveloped and developed properties with and without waterfront to a variety of new to older homes, several commercial properties, boats of various sizes, and a large industrial property on the shore. Several residents stated the loss of the logging industry, (we did note a small lumber mill in operation), and a sagging fishing revenue had produced an economic doldrums effect.  Across the street from our lodging each day we saw a representative of the self employed each day tending after his crabbing business. HIs day's activities were adjusted to the tides it seemed. Some days home in the middle of the afternoon, others not arriving until dusk. A "For Sale by Owner" sign on his two story home. The nations economy is shouldered by people. Each one makes a contributing share however small or large. People get bye during hard times. Petersburg did have a number of storefronts for lease on main street which the Taxi Driver told us recently were occupied by various gift trade shops. The regions Fish and Game office, a Division of Forestry office, a courthouse, a rest home, hospital, Alaska Airlines Terminal with two flights daily, air tours with fixed wing and helicopter, charter fishing boats, the Coast Guard has a large vessel tied in the harbor, nine churches, a pizza parlor, a sit down restaurant perched on pilings in Middle Harbor for sale by owner, a certain population of native coastal peoples, two taverns, a hardware with seemingly every item one could need in that area of life, an old paid for supermarket on main street, and a new un-paid for supermarket half way to the airport, and a reported full time population of 3008. Much of the payroll from the three major fish processors in town flies out of town with the globally mixed seasonal workers on "the slime line". At the area of the Harbormasters office evenings the tired workers gathered along the sidewalk. Numerous languages issued from various cliques along the way. Men and women have gone to the sea for ages, no different here. The processor business comptrollers and owners have found the minimum wage half way or so between $7 and $8 and time and a half for overtime more economical than the $11 or so paid to the unionized workers who once populated the canneries. We have not wintered in Petersburg. That it is a different season we can only imagine. Rain may fall in Spain, but Little Norway gets some too. Average rainfall is 99,99 inches. That is 8,3 feet per year. Knee high brown boots that have a cream colored trim are the native wear. Rain and snow visit Petersburg, and a long gray wet winter, with shortened daylight hours prevails.
