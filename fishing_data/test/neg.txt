Campground Flooding in BC, CanadaThe RV Park we've been staying in is directly on the Harrison River in the Fraser Valley of southwestern British Columbia, Canada. Over the past couple of weeks, the water in the Harrison & Fraser Rivers has risen to its highest level in 40 years and many area campgrounds are partially or completely submerged.  There have been floods like this before, but not for quite some time.  We drove to several campgrounds today, including Matsqui Trail Regional Park on the Fraser River in the metro Vancouver region between Abbotsford & Mission, and Kilby Park campground at the Kilby Historic site in Harrison Mills. We also paddled our canoe through the parking lot of our own park, also in Harrison Mills.  We tried to visit one other nearby park, but all the RVs have been evacuated and the gate is locked.  There are reports of flooding in many parts of the BC Lower Mainland, including here in the Fraser Valley.  Chilliwack and other areas are affected by the Fraser River, and we're of course affected by the flooding on the Harrison River.  Luckily for us, our RV park is on a hill and we're at the top of it.  Only the very lowest-lying sites have been directly affected, where you can canoe from the Harrison River right up the boat ramp and into the parking lot, which we did.  We're hoping for fewer rainy days and abating of flood waters soon.  Lower temperatures would help as well, slowing the snowmelt in the surrounding Coast Mountains.

Laying Low in Logan Lake, British Columbia, CanadaI am just laying low at the municipal Logan Lake campground with my 30 amp connection and my free OTA cable TV chilling with Sammie the Pooper....  Decided to come up here on Labor Day to avoid the traffic madness of everyone else up here over the long weekend.  Us retired unemployed folks can do that! LOL.  I am just enjoying the quiet shoulder tourist season here in western Canada in the RV. Travel where I want and when I want. I feel like Nomadic Fanatic with a passport and a pension!  Logan Lake will be my future summer home.  It is a slice of my personal heaven up here.  In the meantime, stay safe folks and Keep Your Wheels on the Ground!

Magnificent Canadian Rocky Mountains near Banff, Alberta, CanadaMagnificent Canadian Rocky Mountains near Banff, Alberta, Canada.  Join us on a soothing photographic slide show journey through the beautiful Rocky Mountains of Alberta and British Columbia, Canada in May, 2001.  We will start just outside of Calgary at the Olympic Village, home of the 1988 Winter Olympics and then travel into Banff National Park to see Lake Louise.  We were surprised to see the emerald blue/green lake was still locked in winters grip.  Do you see our reflections in the reflecting ball?    In Banff we stopped to take pictures at the Banff National Park administration building and the Banff Springs Hotel.  A seven minute ride on the gondola took us to the top of Sulphur Mountain for the most spectacular views and photo opportunities in Banff National Park.  Back off the mountain we toured the Cave and Basin National Historic Site, the birthplace of Canada's National Park system, which began here in 1885.   As we travelled north on the Ice Fields Parkway we drove past Bow Lake and the Num-Ti-Jah Lodge stopping for the evening at the Glacier View Inn.  Our corner room overlooked the glacier and the beautiful late winter surroundings. The next day we were off to the Athabasca Glacier on a snow coach tour to the upper reaches of the glacier just below the Columbia Ice Field.  These coaches were made specifically for this glacier.  As a matter of fact, the diesel engines in the snow coaches are the same model that powers generators for the Glacier View Inn since power lines have not reached this remote stretch of the park, if ever!   As the glaciers melt, their waters cut their way to the oceans creating dynamic scenery such as Athabasca Falls. The water is laden with fine powder called rock flour and the water carries this milky, abrasive substance downstream into lakes creating stunning beauty such Emerald Lake where we took a leisurely canoe ride.

Watertown Lakes - The CampersWaterton Lakes National Park is a national park located in the southwest corner of Alberta, Canada, and borders Glacier National Park in Montana, USA. The park contains 505 km2 (195 sq mi) of rugged mountains and wilderness.  The Crypt Lake Trail is one of the premium hikes in Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta, Canada. It is accessed by a dedicated ferry service operating from the Waterton Park Townsite.  The cascading Crypt Falls are over 150 metres (490 ft) high and are fed by Crypt Lake in the hanging valley above the falls. The last part of the trail is the ascent to Crypt Lake. This part is more challenging; in parts the walk runs at the edge of steep drops, secured by cable and also involves crawling through a narrow, but short, tunnel. Finally the trail reaches the shores of Crypt Lake through a small forest.   This video could not be made without the amazing friends Maksym Ovchinnikov and Pavel Skyba  This AWESOME soundtrack was created by my amazing friend Serge Gamache. Hopefully soon will be available for download.    Film and Edited by Lucas Mendonca using a GoPro Hero 3+ Black, on a bike mount and a Sony NEX 5N ( which broke during our hike)   Edited using Adobe Premiere Pro CS6  Make sure to follow me on Facebook and don't forget to subscribe on our page.

Craziest Adventure Trip of Desi Boys to The Killarney Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada!!!A trip by 5 Desi Buddies to Canadian Provincial Park (The Killarney).  So far this was the best Provincial Park we ever have been to, With no restrictions and full privacy. All the camping sites were with enough distance which was best for the friends like us who went to enjoy late night party with campfire and beer :) George lake was very near by to our campsite which was so amazing. We did cliff jumping, canoy sailing, And Hiking to "the Crack" trail was the most amazing part(One advice don't give up on halfway to trail, The view from the top is worth hiking a long trail). Staff at the park was, so friendly they didn't bother while we were talking and enjoying outside till early morning.I would love to visit this park again and again. I would say this 2 days at Killarney was way better than camping grounds at Tobermory with half price and they don't even charge for person more than 2. I would highly recommend this park just go for it guys you will surely have great time as we had cheers :).

Barrier Lake!first gopro video :) lil day at barrier lake, kananaskis
Killarney, Bell-David Lake Loop, October/2011Day#1  Departed Bell Lake access October 3, 2011. Paddled into strong headwinds north through Bell and 3 Mile Lakes to 30 m portage ( lift over ) into Balsam Lake staying on this lake at Campsite 113 this was a nice clean campsite Day#2  Broke camp after breakfast,we were on the water by 10:30am. Paddled through Balsam Lake to the 645 m portage (Gruelling for 1st 200 m very steep) into David Lake. A spectacular view of Silver Peak awaits you at the end of this portage. From here we paddled around David Lake to look for available sites we discovered we were the only people on the lake ( later we seen the group of seven we had seen yesterday in balsam they set up on 121 on the other end of the lake). After looking most of the sites we chose 106, 40 m strait up hill the view was fantastic. About 2am we awoke for bladder relief, on the way back to the tent I looked down the ridge with my headlamp only to have 2 very round eyes looking back about 40 m away halfway down the ridge. The wife was back at the tent and asked if we could get in yet I hollered "NO". Then the Eyes slowly turned away and it was dark.Knowing our barrel was hung safely and our camp food free.We got back in the tent went to sleep.  Day#3  Awaking at 8:00am I did not mention the bear to Heather until morning she said she would not have been  able to sleep had I told her earlier. This day being our layover we had our breakfast, pumped water, packed lunch in a day pack, cleaned up, and hung the food barrel getting on the water at 10:30am. We then paddled to the Boundary Lake portage to start our hike to Silver Peak after stashing our canoe we headed up the trail in full fall colours to Boundary Lake to where it crosses the LaCloche Silhouette trail. Here we followed the blue markers until we came out heading up a white quartz ridge where there were cairns (piles of rocks) that are used for navigation on the trail. From here you could see almost all of Boundary Lake the colours and Beauty are indescribable and have to be seen even pictures can't do justice. As we were reaching the top there was a great big black bear standing 40 m away right beside the cairn marking the trail at the top of the ridge, looking right at us. I took one quick picture while telling my wife that there was a bear right there then raised my hiking poles up in the air and with one loud "HEY BEAR" it turned and walk off the top of the ridge towards Boundary Lake. With luck having us going the opposite way once we reached the top. When we did reach the top the bear was feeding150 m down the ridge I took 30 seconds of video and a few quick pics spending any more time near the bear than necessary would be foolish. So we continued down the LaCloche Silhouette trail again towards Silver Peak trail with a keen eye on our back. The trail heads down from here to end of Boundary Lake then hooks up with the Silver Peak trail from hear 2 km up hill brutal to say the least, hiking boots are essential . While reaching the top is a satisfying experience on its own the view that awaits you is simply breathtaking. After a much needed rest, lunch, and many photos we headed back down to our canoe then paddled back to camp without seeing the bear again. With supper cooked and the barrel hung an hour before dark, we set out looking for firewood enough for that nights fire and some extra as is customary for the next  weary souls who pass this way. Had a fire then headed to bed tired from the 8 km round trip hike and had an uneventful night (no bears).  Day#4  We woke at daybreak it was cold so we rolled up the sleeping gear, tent, clothes, and camp shoes  packing it all in the Sealine pack this kept us warm. We then had breakfast, cleaned up, and packed the rest in the pantry barrel then loaded our canoe hitting the water by10:30am. From camp 106 we paddle all the way across David Lake to the 200 m portage into David Creek. This was an easy portage we had a snack break after completing portage. Then paddled through David Creek, which was beautiful with all fall colours along the white quartz ridges of Silver peak. After a short paddle we arrived at the 775 m portage back to Bell Lake. This portage was relatively strait forward but looked like it could be a bitch in wet weather. We completed the portage then headed into Bell Lake stopping to use the thunder box on site 74 we then ate lunch reflecting on our travels and experiences  while looking at Silver Peak. With mixed emotions we headed for the Bell Lake access, on one hand we were really going to miss all this tranquility and on the other hand our tired old bodies begged for a soft bed.   The weather on this trip was simply gorgeous, with the exception of a couple of stiff headwinds we could not have asked for better trip with only one other group on David and Balsam Lakes it had the feeling of remoteness not often found in this park.

Sunshine/Lake Louise BackcountryMe and some friends skiing Lake Louise and Sunshine backcountry this year.  Was filmed with a helmet cam and a digital camera.

Rocky Mountains (Canadian Rockies) North America Canada video HDThe Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than 3,000 miles (4,800 km) from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west.  The Rocky Mountains were initially formed from 80 million to 55 million years ago during the Laramide orogeny, in which a number of plates began to slide underneath the North American plate. The angle of subduction was shallow, resulting in a broad belt of mountains running down western North America. Since then, further tectonic activity and erosion by glaciers have sculpted the Rockies into dramatic peaks and valleys. At the end of the last ice age, humans started to inhabit the mountain range. After Europeans, such as Sir Alexander Mackenzie, and Americans, such as the Lewis and Clark expedition, started to explore the range, minerals and furs drove the initial economic exploitation of the mountains, although the range itself never became densely populated.  The Canadian Rockies (French: Rocheuses canadiennes) comprise the Canadian segment of the North American Rocky Mountains. They are the eastern part of the Canadian Cordillera, which is a system of multiple ranges of mountains which runs from the Canadian Prairies to the Pacific Coast. The Canadian Rockies mountain system comprises the southeastern part of this system, laying between the Interior Plains of Alberta and Northeastern British Columbia on the east to the Rocky Mountain Trench of BC on the west. The southern end borders Idaho and Montana of the USA. In geographic terms the boundary is at the Canada/US border, but in geological terms it might be considered to be at Marias Pass in northern Montana. The northern end is at the Liard River in northern British Columbia. --------------------- Thank you for watching! Please Like, Comment, Subscribe and Share with your friend!

Canada existed prior to 1867 within both the French and British empires.   Canada Day is frequently referred to as "Canada's birthday", and the first day of summer.

Helicopter to Mt. Assiniboine Naiset Hut, hiking the Rocky MountainsWe flew by helicopter into and out of the Mt. Assiniboine Lodge at the beginning of July, 2014. Located high in the Rocky Mountains near the B.C. Alberta border, melting snow fed rushing streams and waterfalls. The scenery was stunningly beautiful. We stayed in the rustic Naiseth Huts and ate our meals in the well equipped and clean kitchen building. There are lots of hiking options, across wide meadows and up to lookouts above the treeline. We didn't see any bears, but there were signs that they had been there last year. We didn't, but you can hike in and out, camp in tents, or stay in the lodge and have your meals prepared.

Spring Thaw on the Current RiverThe goal was to hike along the Current River, view the spring thaw, and reach the remains of the dam that once held Onion Lake. The recent high temperatures had caused more melting than anticipated. Silliness and nonsense happened as wet feet could not be avoided. Spirits remained high, and we had a good hike despite needing to turn back early due to water levels across the road.

Victoria BC Johnson Street Bridge DemolitionA victim of neglect; the beginning of the end for our iconic blue bridge.  In 2011 the City of Victoria,British Columbia, Canada decided to replace the 87 year old Johnson street blue bridge.  The structure, designed in 1920 and completed in 1924, is one of the few remaining JosephStrauss designed bascule bridges left in North America. Of particular note are the two adjacent bascule spans carrying road and rail traffic respectively.  Joseph Strauss later went on to design San Francisco's Golden Gate bridge.  On Friday February 24th 2012, demolition of the blue bridge began with the removal of the rail bascule;  perhaps severing forever, Victoria's historic rail link to the rest of Vancouver Island.  City council chose not to include a rail component in the new design.  The city of Victoria publishes their Johnson street bridge info. here: http://www.johnsonstreetbridge.com  The project is not without controversy and other information is available at: http://johnsonstreetbridge.org/  and... http://focusonline.ca/?q=search/node/johnson%20street%20bridge amongst others...  History buffs, have a look here: http://www.hallmarksociety.ca/Harbeck/59.htm  ....and don't forget Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_Street_Bridge  etc., etc.  This short video marks  the beginning of the end for our iconic blue bridge.  If only there had been a proper maintenance plan in place through the years.... Controversy aside, the start of demolition was spectacular....and yes it was raining hard that day!  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE. April 2012. Read David Broadland's analysis in Victoria's Focus magazine... http://focusonline.ca/?q=node/357 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE. April 2012. by Patrick Murphy, a letter writer to Victoria's Focus magazine... http://focusonline.ca/?q=node/366  "Smoke and mirrors at City Hall  For those who have not watched a sheep-herding demonstration, I commend to you a Victoria City Council committee of the hopeless I snoozed through recently.  In March this flock met to hear from its highly-paid ring knockers about why the new Blue Bridge is going to cost 20 percent more for now and probably double before it is never built. For hours these so-called professionals droned on and the dutiful flock did not even ask the traditional "How high?" when staff told them to jump. The issue was why the price had gone up so dramatically over what voters had been promised in a referendum. A full report was presented two days prior to the meeting, but since our councillors are not bright enough to read it, the gang of engineers read it to them, and, oh what a song and dance it was.  Why, they have to pay more for insurance on construction. There would be more millions for archaeological costs. Who would have thunk you would have to get insurance on a project? And what a surprise to discover First Nations had lived there. I wonder if they lived anywhere else in the province?  The presentation was mind-boggling. One consultant gave a Power Point show of bridge designs and noted they were in 3D. One of several thousand examples given of bridges that may or may not be built was in Ireland with a prison in the background where "Irish independents" were kept, so this showed what a bridge could do. Was this a sales pitch for a new bridge or an explanation of why costs had gone through the roof? One thing made clear was that all these bridges were "iconic." Then there was the startling revelation that the seabed was irregular. Apparently, it started high and went down. Guess no previous bridge builder here had discovered that.  All this was in the report, but none of the sheep said "Get on with it. We know your smoke and mirrors: Why has the bill gone up?"  Great blather was made of the fact the whole project had been peer reviewed. Who were these peers—the Smurfs?  No one suggested the staff overseeing this should be fired. No one suggested the engineers be fired and it was time to cut losses and re-evaluate with someone who knew what they were doing.  No, it was the old saw of "We have spent this much already, so we might as well carry on."  So when a new bridge does open—maybe—in 12 years, the cost will be closer to $200 million. Who would have thought the province was so wise in keeping out of this farce?  Patrick Murphy" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part 2  Algonquin Park, Tim Lake Solo Camping 2013This is Part 2 of my Tim Lake Camping Video Blog.. Lots of Loons, nice views..  Tim Lake is a easy paddle into Algonquin, except when the wind is blowing hard. My trip out at the end consisted of battling a 15-20k wind all the way back to the parking lot. There are 6 campsites on the lake, most of them not particularly good for children. Sharp drop offs into deep water, and lots of kiddie loving leaches. Once you find a good place to camp with children, you have to train children to camp in the woods. Among other things, you should inform them that BEARS love little children. If their nice and quiet, the BEARS will not know they are even there. But, once they start yelling, screaming, crying, the BEARS will know Exactly where they are and come looking for them..........At Night..........In The Dark...(''')-.-(''')     So, If your camping the interior of Algonquin, please keep your children quiet for every ones sake. Particularly theirs! The BEARS, and other campers will appreciate it! You might even get to see some other wildlife....They appreciate quiet too... :=)

Voices of Bute Inlet (part 1 of 2)Bute Inlet is on the front line for corporate greenwash and environmental devastation. This wilderness is threatened by a mammoth industrial power project under the guise of "green power". Private companies are running amok in BC, staking claim to creeks and rivers for private power generation. Bute inlet, known as BC's Himalayas, has been staked by Plutonic Power and General Electric for a proposed 1,000 Megawatt project which would put 17 rivers into pipes. Home to the last sustainable population of grizzly bears on the coast, "supernatural BC" stands to lose a gem of it's crown, and public control of it's power assets...

Survival heating tool "FIREWAALL-003" made in CanadaDesign by SPORTES inc. Copyright 2016  100% made in Canada Pre order on our web site www.sportesoutdoortools@gmail.com  ''FIREWAAL with two ''A'' 'because we burn wood Better outdoors''      The FIREWAALL-003 is an outdoor heating wood-burning tool for one to two people camping or surviving in nature. Compact and movable, it plays the role of raised rack + wood distributor and heat reflector to the fireplace.  • 100% made in Canada • 3/32 "thick laser cut / folded Stainless steel 304L  • 4,5 Lb  • Width 13 inches x 13,25 inches High • Four main components:  1 perforated base plate / combustion chamber 1 separator / wood rack 2 structural legs and dividers / wood rack  HISTORY  We observed that some extreme campers (Bushcrafters) erected a wooden wall stacked horizontally behind their campfire to reflect the heat towards them. This method, apparently inspired by the sheet metal or the bricks at the back of the stoves and internal fireplaces, seemed laborious to implement. Problems such as the significant upwards heat loss upward (usual on a campfire to the ground) added to the complexity and time of erecting a 'wall' behind the fire made no sense.  FEATURES  • No tools required • NO contact between floor and fire • Oppportunity to make fire in any outdoor environment and conditions • Self-feeding wood log supply by gravity • Optimization of energy efficiency by reflecting heat and light • Orientability of the fire depending on wind direction  • Optimization of the oxygen supply during combustion • Mobility of the fire rack   The efficiency of combustion and the fluidity of gravity feeding of wood is extremely efficient and requires little effort. Unlike a traditional fireplace open to the ground, the user does not have to blow the fireplace and go all around the pitt to push the burnt wood down to the center so the fire does not go out .   The FIREWAALL-003 has been designed to provide:  • More heat • More light • More combustion • Less handling   CREDITS:  Host :         Cedric Sportes / founder SPORTES inc Direction :  Christophe Terrade Editing :      Maxime Dumont  Music:        GOODMAN by Futuro Pelo (benjamin sportes)   Copyright 2016.

Part 1, Algonquin Park, Tim Lake Solo Camping August 2013This is my first time back to Tim Lake in Algonquin Park in 8 years. I spent 6 nights from Sunday August 4th to Saturday August 10th. I usually camp at the same spot on this lake every time I'm in here. Over the years I've Probably spent 200 nights on the island. This is a video blog of this trip. I usually set up a base camp, and go out every day from there. I've been Solo camping in Algonquin since 1985. Took 8 years off because my Kids said I was getting too old to spend that much time alone in the woods, so I bought a bigger Canoe (Ebbtide Cruiser, sleeps 4, 27 feet long). But that type of boating was not for me so I sold it, and I'm back in the park every summer until I'm 'really' too old to do this any more.. Don't forget to watch part two, it's shorter, but more loon calls, and the windy paddle back.

Ren Neo and Leo at Whistler Optimist Sailing Camp  july 2011The boys sailed for 5 days at Whistler Sailing association on Alta lake in Whistler. The class photo was doodled on by Leo I was going to blur there faces out for privacy concerns but he said he had a better idea . It was Rens 13th birthday and I got him a water proof video camera so the beginning footage is quite dodgy as they have never used is before.  Ren really excelled at this sport I think there is so much the same as riding hands motion balance core strength and so on . His coach said Ren is in the top 3 of the fastest learners he has ever seen in sailing . after 5 days Ren is onto his White sail 3 and will be training for some races.. He is so stoked !!!!!!!!!  Neo was using the camera the most as his weight was so little it made the boat handling quiet hard for him .  At 6:18 Rens coach starts filming a little run with Ren he looks pretty good for the little time he has been on the water sailing He almost capsizes once but does a quiet recovery .   At the end of the Video is Zen being the center of attraction and his sailing class sings happy birthday

Parks Canada staff in Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve, National Marine Conservation Area Reserve and Haida Heritage Site were lucky enough to capture this amazing springtime dolphin stampede on camera.  Pacific white-sided dolphins are extremely active, and sometimes approach boats to "bow ride" the pressure waves created by their bows. They are usually sighted in pods of 10-100 animals, although super groups of up to 2000 have also been seen.

Princess Louisa Inlet - British Columbia (trailer)Princess Louisa Inlet is a remote place on the west coast of British Columbia, is a mere gap of six kilometres long and just a few hundred meters wide and may possibly be be one of the most beautiful places on earth. It can only be reached by boat or float plane at the tip of the long body of water called Jervis Inlet.In 1919 a young man named James MacDonald discovered, fell in love and filed for ownership of the lands  surrounding the inlet, with Chatterbox Falls at it's head. In 1953 MacDonald transferred ownership of these land to the Princess Louisa International Society.  The sheer cliffs rise a mile high, straight from the water. All around is the thick rainforest; the trees are tall and their trunks are covered with greeny/blue moss. The forest glades are deeply shaded and one half expects gnomes, elves and fairies to arrear from around the trees. The tweeting and chattering of the birds are constant. It is a truly magical place, restful and tranquil. Everyone should be fortunate enough to see Princess Louisa Inlet, the Princess as MacDonald referred to it, at least once in their lives.

Sailboat Ran Aground at White Rock PierAfter a regatta a skipper unfamiliar with the very narrow channel at the White Rock Pier in BC went too wide and ran aground with 5 people on board.  No one was injured, and the sailboat wasn't damaged, but it was an ebb tide, which meant the water lever was dropping and would strand the boat even further as the tide went out.  The challenge was to free the sailboat from the sand ledge as soon as possible before it rolled on its side and took on water.  The LYMC.ca - Lower Mainland Yacht Club moors their fleet at this pier and a number of its members and experienced sailors were on hand working to tow the grounded sailboat free. Some of them had raced in the regatta that day.  Easy fixes were tried first, like rocking the grounded sailboat and pulling it by hand with lines from the dock, but the keel was wedged in the sand too tight.  A second plan to use a catamaran called "BAD KITTY" and to use a winch on "Lightcure" were quickly put in place.  Bad Kitty attached a tow line to the halyard of the grounded sailboat with the intent of pulling the top of the mast over freeing the keel from the sand, while simultaneously a line was attached to the starboard winch of Lightcure that would pull the bow of the grounded boat forward.  While the grounded sailboat was being towed from both points, it gunned its engine to assist in being freed.  It was an interesting exercise demonstrating why speed and teamwork are critical in rescue operations.  This is a good example for training purposes, but keep in mind all situations are different and this might not be the right or safe solution for you.

Sailing Bute Inlet, B.C. SlideshowThis is a 35 mile solo cruise up Bute Inlet (British Columbia) to Waddington Harbor at it's head July 9-10, 2015.  The inlet is long, wide, and uniformly very deep without any recommended or desirable anchorages along the way.  I experienced no advantage going up with the tide and winds were lite.  My single night at Waddington Harbor was peaceful as not another soul was there as well as no AM, FM, VHF radio, and very poor reception on SSB.  The return trip was against the tide and 25-28K winds gusting to 34K resulting in speed as low as 2.4K; turning around was not an option for fear of losing the rubber dinghy.  It was an almost 12 hour duty day at the helm to a suitable anchorage outside Bute at Von Donop Inlet.  Photos were taken with a Sony Bloggie MHS-TS20.  Music is Seeger by John Deley and the 41 players from the YouTube library.      I created this video with the YouTube Slideshow Creator (http://www.youtube.com/upload)

BEAVER - Species at Risk Wilderness Committee British ColumbiaBEAVER. Cindy and I feel honored by this e-mail.  Hello,  I am the Species at Risk Outreach Coordinator for the Wilderness  Committee, working on a public campaign to support endangered species  legislation in BC. We have 1,600 species at risk in the province, and  BC is one of only two provinces in Canada with no legislation to  protect our wildlife.  I am looking for footage to include on our website (http://www.lastplaceonearth.ca/  ) and to promote our campaign. I believe you have fantastic footage of  wildlife species in BC, and I am wondering if you would let us use  your work for promoting this important campaign. We will give you  credit of course. Please let me know what you have and if you could  send me some links to your work.  Thank you, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.  Cheers,

Joffre Lakes Provincial Park Hike to Matier GlacierJoffre Lakes Provincial Park is about 3 hours from Vancouver, just past Pemberton. One weekend, my wife, a friend and I drove along the Sea-to-Sky Highway to Joffre Lakes Provincial Park.     The trail at Joffre passes three lakes, each a striking, saturated turquoise blue. We quickly approached the first lake and observed U-shaped valleys, jagged peaks, silt and lateral moraines created by Matier Glacier perched atop Joffre Peak.     We emerged into a clearing shortly past the first lake where the valley opened up to display a million shades of green. Inexperienced hikers might have difficulty crossing piles of boulders at this most rugged section of the trail.     For most of the trek we were in the presence of a powerful, churning mountain stream. We crossed it several times on crude bridges made of fallen logs. At the end of the trail we arrived at the majestic Matier Glacier where some hikers camped overnight. Waterfalls spewed from the glacier carrying blue silt, which colored the lakes below.
ManigotaganPaddling 70 kms of quiet, picturesque stretches of water that glides through boreal and deciduous forests, is turned to adventure when interrupted by spectacular rapids and falls. Manigotagan River Provincial Park  in Manitoba, Canada features impressive topography ranging from sheer rockfaces topped with craggy lichen and Jack Pine, to impressive stretches of Balsam Poplar, Elderberry and Green Ash. The Manigotagan River, meaning "bad throat", was long ago named by a group of hunters who when calling game were answered by an old bull moose with a garbled throat. The old bull may be long gone, but the tranquil spirit of the river can still catch you by surprise.  Filmed by: Michael Farrugia & Greg Klar  Date: July 2011  Camera: Nikon D5100, Nikon D3100, GoPro HD  www.FFDocs.org

Solo 3-day backpacking hike in Banff Rocky MountainsSolo 40 km backpack hike to Howse pass in Banff Park, Alberta.  This is an abandoned fur trading route.  I show tricks for making life easy in the wilderness. The trail was in such bad shape, with so much deadfall, that I had to abandon my attempt to reach the pass. Check out Brian Patton's blog on this trail at: http://canadianrockiestrailguide.com/howse-pass-the-disappearing-trail/  He's one of the co-authors of my favorite hiking book "The Canadian Rockies Trail Guide".  Best part of making these video (other than the hike) is matching music.  For this video I used:  1:50 Instrumental version of Madonna's "Amazing" found on YouTube.  7:20 Instrumental version of the Tragically Hip's "Wheat King" found on YouTube.  The Hip are an amazing Canadian band from Ontario.  15:10 Instrumental version of Collective Soul's "Shine".  Done by Nick Scott.  He's on YouTube as Ambonick1 (https://www.youtube.com/user/ambonick1)  19:20 Instrumental version of U2's "Bad".  Great song by an even greater band.

Backcountry 2011 - Island Lake Canoe Route720P Is best quality. 1080P has blur to it. Completed a trip into Island Lake Forest and Barrens Provincial Conservation Reserve on the Canada day long weekend. This Conservation Reserve is 45 minutes north of Parry Sound and access is via Wahwashkesh Lake. Ontario Headed up farm creek and camped on Wolf Lake for the first night, then continued into Dutton Lake and back to Island Lake for our final night. the route to Island Lake is fairly straight forward with easy portages, however when exploring the other lakes, portages can be rough to non-existent. Take caution when locating the portages between the small lake north of Wolf towards Dutton and the longer portage from the small lake East of Dutton into Island Lake. (the latter is riddled with multiple blazed  snowmobile and ATV trails, and there are about 5 portages blazed through here. The most straight forward is flagged and spray-painted orange. NOTE: Take the landing on the South-East side of the small lake and NOT the snowmobile opening as it is longer and easier to get lost. (Found out the hard way). Novice-Intermediate to Island Lake Intermediate-Advanced for access to the other lakes Makes a great 2-3 day trip or a relaxing week exploring all the islands and surrounding lakes.

The Castle of White Otter LakeThis is my 22 minute documentary that tells the true story of Jimmy McOuat who constructed a castle singlehandedly out of red pine logs back in the early 1900's. The film contributed to the castle's eventual restoration which still stands on the shore of White Otter Lake in the wilderness of Northwestern Ontario.   The Castle of White Otter Lake was produced, directed, shot and edited by me, Peter G. Elliott and the script was researched and written by Elinor Barr of Thunder Bay. Jimmy McOuat was played by Nick Kaminecky and the original music is by Cathy Elliott. A special thanks to Gordon Pinsent who narrated the film for me for a very small fee. An extended thanks to friends and family who helped me back in the early '80s.  I shot this film on a $12,000 budget using my 16mm Bolex camera, an Ontario Arts Council grant and an editing room at The National Film Board. The film was shown on CBC's Canadian Reflections and on Global Television and various broadcasters in the British isles during the 1980's.

Air Force Day at RCAF Station Summerside - June 19638mm footage shot by my father, Harold Phillips, on June 15, 1963, which was Air Force Day at RCAF Station Summerside, Prince Edward Island, Canada.  My father and mother both volunteered for service in the RCAF during World War II.  My father served with the 119th Bomber Reconnaissance Squadron as ground crew in Trenton ON, Yarmouth NS, Sydney NS, Gander NL, Edmonton AB, and Watson Lake, YT.  My mother worked in special operations in Torbay NL and Sydney NS, plotting convoy operations and submarine surveillance in the North Atlantic.  There were many planes at this airshow, but of note are the Golden Hawks, the RCAF's aerobatic team from 1959-64 and the precursor to today's Canadian Forces 431 Air Demonstration Squadron (the Snowbirds).  You can read more about the Golden Hawks on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Hawks  The Golden Hawks had appeared in Charlottetown, PEI the year before, where an estimated 25,000 people jammed the roads leading to the air show (the population of Prince Edward Island in 1962 was just over 100,000).  Read about that day here: http://islandnewspapers.ca/islandora/object/guardian%3A19620820-003  Some great footage of the Golden Hawks in action from the National Film Board of Canada: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVo9InROAXY

Nation Lakes Canoe RouteA seven day trip on the Nation Lakes Canoe Route north of Fort St. James which is NW of Prince George, BC, Canada.  Aug 22-29, 2009.  This trip is beautiful on big lakes.  It is similar to the Bowron Lakes in terms of length and difficulty.  But the solitude is much greater.  We saw only one canoe, day 2, of our trip and a power boat in the distance on day 5.  That, and a couple cabins on Chuchi, were the only signs of people that we saw.  We used Nation Lakes Canoeing Camp (www.nationlakes.com) for the canoe rental and shuttle (5 hrs on logging roads).   Trip report: http://northernwaters.shutterfly.com Photo album: www.flickr.com/photos/94506934@N00/sets/72157622317029516

Oregon Dave interviews Phil Cotton of the Wabakimi ProjectOregon Dave Interviews Phil Cotton (aka Uncle Phil), founder of the Wabakimi Project, a unique grassroots volunteer initiative founded in 2004 to explore and document the historical and traditional canoe routes of Wabakimi Provincial Park in Central Ontario Canada. The end result is set of maps to help visitors plan and mount self-directed, self-guided canoe trips in the Wabakimi Area, a world class canoe destination.  Phil and I discuss why this area is so important and what the Project is accomplishing. At the very end Uncle Phil explains and demonstrates the purpose of the conical birch bark device I found near a portage into a small lake, while participating in the Project’s first trip of 2015.   Key Takeaways:  The Park was created in 1983 and expanded later to protect the remaining Woodland Caribou, a key indicator species. Access to the park itself is limited, making surrounding provincial parks and Crown lands important to map and protect as well.  The park and surrounding areas is much  larger than BWCA and Quetico combined, containing a world class canoe area that sees limited use. The mapping of canoe routes, portages & campsites is vitally important for the ultimate management plans to protect this resource for the future.  These plans are still in an early state of development.  As the Wabakimi Project comes to a conclusion in a few more years, the new non-profit Friends of Wabakimi (www.wabakimi.org/fow/) will eventually assume responsibility for the volunteer conservancy efforts to rehabilitate and document canoe routes in the Wabakimi Area and participate in planning processes to advocate for the protection and preservation of the diverse natural, cultural and historical resources of the Wabakimi Area that includes adjacent parks and Crown lands.

Canoeing South Saskatchewan River - Saskatoon, SaskatchewanThe canoe is a Canadian wilderness icon.  It leaves no trace of its passage through the wilds, but it has left an indelible impression on the Canadian psyche.  Ancient aboriginals, early voyageurs and today's canoeists - all have been moved by the canoe - physically and spiritually.  With this in mind, it was only fitting that the GCAT crew spend an afternoon out on a river in a canoe.    We hooked up with outdoor enthusiast and owner of CanoeSki Discovery, Cliff Speer, for a paddle down the South Saskatchewan river.  Cliff has been canoeing these waters for over 30 years and is a firm believer that canoeing heightens the ecological senses.  He says it inspires a desire to care for the wild places that only a canoe can access.  At CanoeSki, they follow the environmental credo of respecting the earth in all their activities. This includes applying conservation principles to all aspects of the operation, practicing minimum impact camping, and contributing to local conservation efforts.  During our paddle we not only enjoyed fantastic autumn weather, but we were fortunate to catch some of the annual migration of Canada geese, snow geese, and sandhill cranes.  One of the great things about canoeing is that without a motor you can blend in with the environment and get the opportunity to truly be at one with nature.    If you ever get to Saskatoon and want to give canoeing a try, call Cliff and he'll be happy to introduce you to one of Canada's favourite outdoor pastimes.    Follow the Great Canadian Adventure Tour Visit our site:  http://www.greatcanadianadventuretour.com/  Join us on Facebook and Twitter: http://www.facebook.com/GreatCanadianAdventureTour http://twitter.com/#!/CanadaAdventure

RC CWR Douglasdale Trail with trailer in towDown to the ridge at Douglasdale with the 2 Axial Honchos and cooler trailer in tow. Will and I took turns towing the trailer and mounted my new GoPro on board to test out a few different views. Trying to figure out what view we are going to use on the CTGs Urban Assault 5. If we take the cooler trailer loaded, we are going to need ALOT of batts to get through the down town run. Can't wait for the 28th so stay tuned for that video. Today was a great day for a trail run and what a great spot too, so close to home. Thanks for watching and enjoy. Cheers.

Temagami Family trip. Canoe crash at Sturgeon River. Happy ending. 2015We went to Temagami Provincial Park for the first time. Ahead of us was up to a week of paddling and camping in this part of Ontario. We started our tour happily at the top of Sturgeon River, and after a few meanders we saw a massive fallen tree blocking the river. The current was very strong, we couldn't manage to stop. We ended up broadside with the canoe sinking, luckily, to the right side of the river, paralel to the big tree trunk.  Everything went under the tree, the canoe, all the gear, ourselves...

French River Village Coponaning Ghost Town Saw Mill Alligator RuinsA trip to the French River area wouldn't be complete without a visit to the old Mill and Village Coponaning Town sites. The wreck symbols on the strip charts near buoy DC3  are supposedly from derelict "Alligator" tug boats left to die, all that remains are their boilers and pieces of tin. The area is now so overgrown it's difficult to piece together the mill site from a vintage low-res internet photo. Still lots of iron bits laying around, and portions of the original derelict steam engine. Anyone know the story about it?  Hard to imagine that a village of 1500 people at some point used to live here.

Waterway Tips #5 - Rice Lake Railway CribbingWhen crossing Rice Lake along the Trent Severn Waterway (TSW), one must be aware of an ancient railway cribbing that straddles the lake close to the entrance of the Otonabee River. This railway cribbing was installed in the mid 1800's but suffered extensive ice damage and was abandoned after only six years of service.   There is a well marked spot to pass safely and is part of the main Small Craft Route that crosses in a east-west direction across the lake. Unfortunately, boaters who are unaware hit this obstruction every year - so keep an eye out for the markers and be aware of where you are!   Rice Lake is one of the largest lakes along the TSW, second only to Lake Simcoe.

The Trent-Severn WaterwayThe Trent-Severn Waterway has many interesting and unique methods for moving boats from one body of water to another. This time-lapse video demonstrates just some of the locks that can be found along the route from Lake Ontario at the Bay of Quinte to Georgian Bay.  Spending the summer visiting these locks, I was amazed by the engineering. Transfers are relatively quick, some as quick as 25 minutes for one sequence. This time-lapse video allows the visitor to see multiple transfers in just five minutes.  I have enjoyed "The Summer of Time Lapse". It reminds me of my film days. I would shoot a roll of 36 and then wait for the C-41 processing before I could see the images. The anticipation is similar with time-lapse, I have to wait for all of the images to be processed into a movie before I can see all the details and movement that I could not see while photographing the sequence.  Completed time-lapse sequences always surprise me, what is captured in the detail. Clouds would appear still during the shoot only to reveal their formation and movement in a time-lapse. Much like a macro image reveals microscopic detail, time-lapse photography reveals details of time and movement.  I have looked at many time-lapse movies by other Photographers. Some convey a serene or calm approach. Others get the “Holy Grail” day to night transition spot on. I love the added motion that moving the camera in some way brings. This movie only utilises the Ken Burns effect provided in iMovie.    I used a Nikon D7100 DSLR and the Triggertrap Mobile intervalometer on my iPad to trigger the camera. Most of the sequences were captured with intervals between 1 and 5 seconds. As the summer progressed, so did the capture settings. I went from Jpeg to Raw adding ND filters trying for the elusive 1/40, f3.5, and ISO 100.  I have invested in LRTimelapse and Adobe Lightroom for the digital darkroom. All sequences were rendered at 24 frames per second. The final movie was edited in iMovie.  Please let me know what you think in the comments below.

The Western Brook Pond Fjord / Gros Morne National Park NewfoundlandThe Western Brook Pond is a Canadian fjord or lake located in Gros Morne National Park on the west coast of the island of Newfoundland. It is in the Long Range Mountains, the most northern section of the Appalachian Mountains.  Rock wallsIt is surrounded by steep rock walls 600 m (2,000 ft) high. Having been carved from the surrounding plateau by glaciers. After the glaciers melted, the land rebounded and the fjord was cut off from the sea. Salty water was eventually flushed from the fjord leaving it fresh. The catchment area is composed of igneous rock with relatively thin soil, so the waters feeding Western Brook Pond are low in nutrients and the lake is classified as ultraoligotrophic. It is fed by Stag Brook at the extreme eastern end of the lake and by numerous waterfalls cascading from the plateau above. One of these, Pissing Mare Falls at 350 m (1,150 ft), is one of the highest in eastern North America.  The lake is accessible by a moderate-easy 3 km (1.9 mi) hiking trail over coastal bogs and low limestone ridges. Two tour boats, one with a capacity of 70 passengers and the other 90 passengers, cruise the lake from June to mid-October. The lake waters are pristine, having had very little impact from human activities. The tour boat operators had to undergo special certification to ensure that their operations would have minimal impact on the environment.  In the early part of the 20th century, a part of the surrounding cliff broke off and fell into the lake, causing a 30 m (98 ft) tsunami.

My Little Island HomeSoong I wrote about the place in which I grew up... Here are the Lyrics as requested  My Little Island Home   How I long to see my Island,  The place that I was born,  To gaze upon her rocky shores,  And the places I once roamed.   To see the sun arisin',  over Snatches Cover to start the day  and﻿ then see her nestle down,  In slumber out o're the bay.   From the Northeast River's rapids  To the Southeast River's shores  To see Mount Pleasant shinin'  from the comfort of my door.  To the Seven Island island lookout To the﻿ "Lane" in July I long to see my home I don't know how i will get by  I'm comin home again I long for home again My island calls my name For her son to come back home  And If youve ever been there you'll love here just like me I dont know why I left there It was just the powers that be  And its only for a﻿ short while that I'll call Alberta home Because my heart longs to be On My Little Island Home

Journey to Baffin 2011- Visit my Flickr at: http://www.flickr.com/photos/danijawIn Summer of 2011, I visited Baffin Island in Nunavut, Canada. I was very touched by the Inuit and some of their stories. Upon my return home, I researched the history of the people and their homeland. I learned a great deal about it all. This is a tribute to the Inuit. I can't wait to go back there, hopefully, in winter. Thank you for greeting me and teaching me how to smile.

Red Deer, Alberta to Saskatchewan River Crossing, Alberta (Highway 11 Westbound) - time lapseDuring Easter weekend I made a couple of road trips around our province.  On the trip I tried to capture some of the scenic highways in the area.  This video is of a portion of Highway 11 from Red Deer, in central Alberta, to Saskatchewan Crossing on the Icefields Parkway.  The name Saskatchewan Crossing refers to the North Saskatchewan River which Highway 11 roughly follows West of Rocky Mountain House.  This route passes through the town of Rocky Mountain House which is named for an early trading fort of the Hudson's Bay Company.  It was established by an early explorer named David Thompson who did extensive mapping of the area West of Rocky mountain House and large portions of the mountains as far South as Washington state.  The Lewis and Clark expedition used some of Thompson's maps on their explorations.  The music used is Angels by Blue Rodeo.  This was filmed on April 5, 2010 at 20x real time.

Snowmobile Hillclimb on "The Onion", Smithers, 29 Dec 07This was my introduction to the snowmobile hillclimb. Basically, the idea is to pilot your craft up the steepest part of the hill possible (to the left) without sliding or tumbling back down the slope to your death. My dear uncle took it upon himself to raise the bar for the young punks, going through the rocks where there's not much snow. Hence the other rider opting out and looking over his shoulder in disbelief, while we all laughed our heads off! But snowmobiles scare the crap outta me on the flat, there's no way you'd get me up there...  Polaris RMK 900 v Ski-Doo  29 December, 2007 "The Onion" Smithers British Columbia Canada

Saskatchewan River Crossing, Alberta to Penhold, Alberta (Highway 11 Eastbound) - time lapseDuring Easter weekend I made a couple of road trips around our province.  On the trip I tried to capture some of the scenic highways in the area.  This video is of Highway 11 from where it begins at Saskatchewan River Crossing on the Icefields Parkway to near Red Deer, Alberta.  I didn't go quite to Red Deer on the return trip, but left Highway 11 by Sylvan Lake and took the back roads home to Penhold.  This Highway cuts through a wide variety of terrain. It begins in the mountains near the continental divide, followed by the heavily treed foothills, and after Rocky Mountain House, the prairies.    The music used is Little Bones and At the Hundredth Meridian by The Tragically Hip.    This was filmed on April 5, 2010 at 20x real time.

Kamloops highlands in AprilA nice area to hike and geocache at Kamloops in my beautiful province of British Columbia.  To get here park your vehicle at the top of the hill on McGill Road, near the university.  It is a cold day towards the end of April, still feeling a little like winter.  The bit of color that comes with the moisture of winter and spring will soon be lost in the summer heat.  Looking to the west you can see the smoke stack from the pulp mill in the Mission Flats area of Kamloops, and in the photos towards the end of this slide show you can see the ponds from the pulp mill, as well as see the beginning of Kamloops Lake.

Lynx Capture ( recapture ) - Nancy Paw-losiTo see more lynx videos go to lynxresearchers' channel.  This is one of our recaptures (January 15, 2008) on the Canada Lynx Project. She is a 22.5 pound female that we have named Nancy Paw-losi. She has put on 2 lbs since we collared her in November, and it suits her beautifully. We are tracking her movements near Rocky Mountain House and Nordegg Alberta, Canada.  If you are wondering why some of  the Lynx Videos are gone, it is because my parents borrowed my account to put up their videos. Now they have their own account.

Blue Whale Bottlenose Dolphin fighting to survive. Close-up experience.Audio: Final Cloud by Kevin McLeod -  http://bit.ly/NNAtTA  This is not your National Geographic  photo essay of Bottlenose Dolphins and Blue Whales, but it definitely  shows our excitement. A family of Florida Gulf Bottlenose Dolphins playfully followed our boat wake on one trip. The St. Lawrence in Quebec gave us the Blue Whales. These ocean creatures are awesome and human friendly, although I sure, if they wanted to, could toss you around like a rubber ducky play toy. The Blue Whales literally surfaced within 15 feet from our rubber Zodiak - thrilling and exciting.   Blue Whales can grow to 100 feet (30 meters) long and weight around 200 tons. An adult Blue Whale can consume as much  as 4 tons of krill per day. The shocking part is that there's less than 5,000 Blue Whales left on our planet -- an endangered species.  They are fighting to survive.   Bottlenose Dolphins are the other extreme of the whale family, and even though they are not considered endangered, only 1 million of them left. To put that in perspective there are 7 billion of us humans.  The Bottlenose Dolphin grows to roughly 12 feet long and weighs about 1,400 pounds.   Enjoy and protect them. Take care of our oceans. Spread the word. We only have one chance.

Hundreds of Dolphins chasing The Cruise Ship Disney WonderAn amazing thing happened on the cruise ship Disney Wonder, a sunset stroll on the walking deck caused a chance encounter with a very large pod of dolphins.  There were dolphins everywhere!  The encounter lasted a little over a minute as the dolphins tired and could not maintain the 15 knot pace of The Disney Wonder cruising the Inside Passage of British Columbia on the way back from an Alaska Cruise enroute to Vancouver. The exact location was Robson Bight.

Board Recovery & Self RescueA lengthy story to this vid... wind was ramping up as I pumped kites, I went through it all; 14/10 & 7m Rises. The 14 had a weak valve that finally gave way and the 10 had too many pin holes in the LE so next I rigged the 7m.   During play time Chris tells me he lost his board and that it's most likely across the bay. So... @ 3:12 is when that adventure starts. I end up finding it after having a fabulous lengthy downwinder, try to bring it back but the wind totally dies, and for good. I end up self rescuing with the 7m in tow but at least we got his board back. Damn good times and OR saves LF's ass.   Heading home the setting sun was poking through the trees, saw a nasty collision then entered the twin sails marking your arrival to Cold Lake.

It's a really great  way to take in the beauty of the Bay of Fundy  wow that was a really cool experience to kayak on the Bay of Fundy we went out to  the Three Sisters and the Sun magically came out and lit them up for us then as we  were paddling back the fog came and its really ominous very cool to just see it  rolling in almost we think that ghost ship is just around the corner  You can go for a hike after kayak as well  Cheers to a good day, Cheers  We're camping on the Bay of Fundy  We see some seals, be very quiet, be very quiet  Well there you have it the Three sisters behind me here at low tide is a very  cool time to be here you can see the base of them.  This is an excellent view of the Three Sisters and a Pillar!  I don't know why they don't call it the Four Sisters, it's the Three Sisters  The Three Sisters are a magnificent rock formation on the Bay of Fundy.  Local Mi'kmaq legend states that powerful god Glooscap  Turned his three sisters into stone when he  left the land and bade them to remain until his return  Behind me is Elephant Rock. It really looks like an elephant  When it's high tide you  can actually kayak right through that so we will be back.  So there's the elephant that we walked to earlier   now you can paddle through it. Incredible  Just shows the power of these tides.  The Bay of Fundy has the world's highest tides  moving more than 100 billion tons of water every six hours and 13 minutes  that's more flow than all the world's freshwater rivers combined.  The tides range 35 to 55 feet  Every Day

BC Ferries Daring Rescue of Man OverboardOriginal Footage.  People on the Powell River to Comox ferry said they saw the man jump from the upper deck.  The crew was quickly in the water to attempt a rescue but the motor of the zodial died.  They then had to put a second zodiak into the water to get to the man.  Luckily there was an ambulance crew on the ferry that tended to the man when he was brought back to the ferry.  Some said that he was a homeless man that jumped but the man himself said he fell (likely to avoid charges).  Police are investigating.

Tug Gulf Regent. Finn bay and Spiller Inlet central coast bc.This  video starts loading at Finn Bay at mouth of the mouth of Rivers inlet, and continues to the upper reaches of Spiller Inlet were we load more logs, Most of our trips were put together this way. We filled in the gaps that the big boys couldn't pick up.... cost wise. Our loads usually consisted of several stops, so the barge was moved to differant sites till we got a full load south bound. Our missed load was picked up next time around. Check out Stryker Island video. My channel has been up for one year now and i appreciate the support from my subscibers. Cheers, Larry   ps.

Frozen, the Sea is frozen, but wait, what do I see out there, Awesome, amazing and incredibleLooking to see what is going on across the road, and then getting a closer look at the great river that flows beyond the ice This Year has been colder than most and there has not been a big thaw or a storm capable of breaking-up the ice that has built-up with many successive extreme cold days/weeks. Even the tides have not broken-up the ice this Year, the flowing waters, mixed with ice are at the edge of where the eye can see. But with the use of deep zoom, I was able to capture the flow as it speeds along, far from shore, on the mighty St-Lawrence estuary (where the river becomes the gulf), here in Sainte-Anne-Des-Monts Quebec, on the Northern shore of the Gaspe peninsula.  merci de votre visionnement, prenez un petit moment afin de visiter https://www.youtube.com/user/danbythesea   Je vous invite a venir visitez mon site:  http://www.danbythesea.com/francais.html   thank you for watching,  take a moment to visit my YouTube page https://www.youtube.com/user/danbythesea  I invite you to visit my site: http://www.danbythesea.com/english.html

Scuba Dive at Isthmus Bay Rd near Lions Head Ont, CanadaRenee and I had a nice shore dive at Lions Head Bridge across the road from 239 Isthmus Bay Rd (see the map on the video).  The path down is a little rocky, so you have to be careful.  There is very limited parking for a few vehicles only.  Water visibility and temperature was better than at Cedar Hill Park.  If you need restroom facilities the best thing to do is use the public restrooms at the beach in downtown Lions Head before you drive to the dive site.  Our dive went north (left) where bottom depth is greater than to the south (right).  Due to silt it may be a little murkier near the lake bottom. Hope you enjoy the video.  Claude and Renee

A snowmobile trip to the Gorge, Newfoundland and Labrador (by Peter Bull, Newfoundland)On March 15, 2011, I went with a group of snowmobilers on a ride to "the Gorge" Western Brook Pond, Gros Morne National Park. Conditions were perfect, unlike 11 days earlier when we had to turn back because of high winds and whiteout conditions (see my other Youtube video). Our 177km trip took us over groomed trails and beautiful backcountry. This ride takes you into Gros Morne National Park. Before you head in, you need to pick up a park pass and a snowmobile permit. Contact the park before heading in. Any group planning the trip should have an experienced guide to lead the way. At 700meters above sea level, conditions can change in minutes from blue sky to whiteouts. River that were frozen over 11 days before were open on this trip. The Gorge is one of the premier snowmoblie trips one can take anywere.
#5 Moricetown Canyon with Curtis CunninghamToday's daily Vlog (part of my daily Vlog challenge with Josh Blaha!) takes place in Moricetown, British Columbia, approximately a half hour's drive north of the town of Smithers.  Curtis Cunningham, regional photographer and my host during this two week stay in Smithers, has shot the canyon numerous times in various seasons and kindly leads the way for me today.  Any questions? Please leave them below and I'll pick some to answer in future daily vlogs :)
RC CWR Trailin with the new Boat trailer for the NDQ jet boatCustom build boat trailer from aluminium, pulled behind the custom build SCX-10 deadbolt. What a great combo and what a lot of fun. Will and I head out for some jet BOATIN and had a blast. The trailer worked awesome and looks darn good too, I must say. It was a fun build, I just looked at a couple pics of what I would like and came up with this. Its 3/8 by 1/2 C channel aluminium, cut and bent then screwed together. No welds in it at all. We already have another idea on the go for another build, its a little different and may take awhile. But if it works out it should be awesome. So stay tuned for more to come :-) Thanks for watching and enjoy, Cheers.

With some stormy weather fronts rolling through the valley, the waves and wind started to pick up. Making it very difficult  to stay upright and cruise the lake. If we jumped a wave and had our boat pointed into the wind it would just flip us over. Will has to make some deep water rescues. The one rescue mission Will had to swim out to rescue the boat and then realized that he could just stand up LOL.  Good times on the lake, thanks for watching and enjoy. Cheers.

RC CWR NQD Tear Into Jet Boat trailsWe loaded up the Jet boat on a trailer and head for the river to hit some rapids. Gotta love this boat for river crawlin and river rock jumping. The plastic guard on the intake was broken and we ended up sucking up some rocks and destroyed the prop again. Good thing I bought a pack of 6 replacement ones LOL. So back to the bench for some repairs and we will be good to go again. I'll have to figure out a good system to stop the rock issue but that should be easy enough. We did have to cut our river run a little short with the jet boat tho. Theres some other really cool spots down there that we want to hit, so hopefully we get back out there soon :-) As always thanks for watching and enjoy, Cheers.

Vallée des Fantômes/Valley of the Phantoms : Parc national des Monts-ValinChaque année au sommet des Monts-Valin dans la région du Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Mère Nature crée des œuvres d'art dans la neige. De renommée provinciale, la Vallée de Fantômes est l'endroit par excellence pour partir en raquettes dans plus de 7 mètres de neige poudreuse. Une expérience hors de l'ordinaire. Réalisation : Anne Kostalas   Mother Nature does some of her best artistic work each winter as she creates eerily wonderful shapes in the snow-covered trees in the Monts-Valin park in the Saguenay - Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec.  Snowshoe through up to 7 metres (22 feet) of snow and experience this incredible display of nature for yourself. Video production by:  Anne Kostalas

I was away on vacation during the CTGs UA6 in a slightly warmer climate in Maui Hawaii. So I dedicate this video to all the boys and girls that turned out for CTGs UA6 in the -5C' weather to take on the streets of Calgary, while I was racing the ocean waving in plus 27C' weather, OH YA and the ocean WON. This was the last RC run of my vacation, do to some salt water issues and electronics LOL. I knew it was going to happen, I always have to push the limits. I don't know for sure but I believe I blow 1 ESC in one rig and some gearing problems in the other. Alittle TLC and I'm sure they will be back hitting the trails in Calgary soon.

A snowmobile trail ride from Steady Brook to Deer Lake, Newfoundland and Labrador (by Peter Bull)Early in March 2012, I took a two hour snowmobile ride from Steady Brook to Deer Lake. A fantastic day of riding on the groomed trails of the Newfoundland and Labrador Snowmobile Federation. Western Snowriders and Junction Trail Blazers share this trail. There was some forestry operations but for the most part, it was a fantastic ride through rolling, twisting trail.
Creepy squatter cabin hidden in Alberta prairiesSkidooing far into the prairies of Alberta and found this cabin in a group of trees about 30km from the nearest road. The wood burning stove was still hot. Looks to be somebodys hideout. There were no other snowmobile trails in or out of the area.

RC CWR Boats, Boats and more BoatsMiss Geico, BlackJack, Mini Mono, IOM sailboats, Tear Into Jet boats and a bunch of other boats. Chris from ARCH (Alberta RC Handbook) set up a - Let's go boating - day at Pine Coulee lake south of Calgary. We must of had a dozen drivers and close to twenty boats. What a great way to spend the day, with a bunch fellow RC guys racing boats on the water on a beautiful summer day. Some of the boats videoed very well and some not so much LOL. The Mini Monos are fast little darts on the water that are very hard to follow with the camera, a blast to drive, watch and race tho. And of course we had a few trucks out and about too. Everybody helping everybody fixing boats, rescuing boats, Aaron aka rookie101 even went for a long swim to help a few boats. Thanks to Lyle for helping and grabbing the camera to catch some rescue missions on film. It always a good time with these greta bunch of RC guys, links below so make sure to check them out.

RC CWR snow baotin journey Down a Frozen RiverThe axial honcho 6X6 hauling the trailer with the Blackjack the snow boating boat in tow. We got some AWESOME on board footage this time with the Go Pro, as went flying down the snow covered river bed. It was a chilly -29 C' when we started and warmed up to -27 C' by the end LOL. But we were sweating like crazy, trudging through knee to waist deep snow for almost 2 hours. We had a blast out there on our chilly snow boatin journey. Thanks for watching and enjoy, hopefully we can get back to this spot for some Super Cub flying. I want to shot down the river bed lined with trees and fly under the bridge and cut it hard up and out. Stay tuned for more :-)  If you haven't check out the trailer for this video here it is, it's a gooder :-) http://youtu.be/72vVmg8GvAA  Make sure you check out the trailer video. http://youtu.be/72vVmg8GvAA  Google+      https://plus.google.com/u/0/?tab=XX Instagram    http://instagram.com/p/g1xKyALCZF/ Face Book   https://www.facebook.com/chris.rappel.5  Music by YouTube Half Pipe by Huma-Huma Hot Heat by Topher Mohr and Alex Elena  RC CWR is Remote Control Chris Will Rappel.

RC CWR TeamRaffee Co. trailer trail run with RC4WD Gelande 2I took the Team Raffee Company trailer out for a trail run with Todd the red TF2 and Grant gray Gelande II FJ. I was pulling the new trailer behind my yellow Gelande II D-90. I also used the BoomRacing 10 mm wheel wideners for the trailer to give it a wider stance. Then I strapped down my Losi Trail Trekker Quad and off we went for a 4 hour trail hike. The trailer is built and looks amazing, this is the same chassis that I built my extreme off-road trailer on. It is a great trailer to build off of or just strap down some cargo and hit the trails. As always thanks for watching and enjoy, Cheers.

Schwatka Lake ice safety refresher trainingthe Whitehorse office of Water Survey all went down to Schwatka Lake & chipped through 4" of ice to create a hole we could practice some ice rescue maneuvors we had learned from previous courses.  Two new recruits to the office so good to go through this again & get used to how we all operate.  Minus 20 this morning but warmed to half that & no discernible wind like they were calling for.  Good fun had by all & none of us had to lop off any frozen digits in the end!;)...Here we are just seeinf how much effort to break thru after chipping thru most of the way...

Free salt giveaway causes chaos at Vancouver fire stationPiles of salt arrived at several Vancouver, BC fire stations and it took only a matter of minutes before it was all gone. Anxious residents made a mad dash with shovels to fill their allotment of one small bucket of salt before it all disappeared. The City of Vancouver’s offer of free salt to deal with icy roads and sidewalks created massive line-ups at fire halls around the city.  The ice melting product was in short supply following a stretch of unusually cold weather.

The Geese of Lake BeaumarisIn an established neighbourhood in Edmonton, Alberta is a rather large and beautiful man-made lake called Lake Beaumaris. In the fall of 2010, thousands of geese have stopped at Lake Beaumaris on their migratory path.

Pack of Wild Eastern Wolves in Algonquin Provincial Park (www.algonquinpark.on.ca)This video shows a pack of 7 wild Eastern Wolves in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada.  Watch as the dominant wolf feeds upon the White-tailed Deer carcass and the other pack members interact.  More dominant animals (holding their tails high when interacting) dominate subordinate pack members (holding their tails between their legs).  At one point a more dominant animal "pins down" a subordinate wolf who "relaxes" until the other wolf departs.  Common Ravens (the numerous birds) await their opportunity to scavenge for a meal throughout the duration of the video.  This is a sight rarely recorded.  Only 5 five wolves are visible at one time, but the whole pack of 7 is in the valley out of the camera's frame.  To learn more about wolves and wolf research in Algonquin Park check: http://www.algonquinpark.on.ca and http://www.sbaa.ca  Recorded from the Algonquin Park Visitor Centre viewing deck on Thursday, February 18, 2010 by Park Staff.

Saskatchewan Landing Provincial Park Wildlife 2008This is my first vid and hopefully many more will follow.  This is not a music vid rather a bunch of wildlife footage with a tune added.  I figured music was better than the useless garble my colleagues and I rambled about.  The pheasant I was watching all summer long but only had one opportunity to catch it on camera.  I was hoping to get a bull snake mimicking a prairie rattler.  Hopefully I will get the footage this summer, it is an awesome thing to witness.  Anyways I hope you all enjoy my shaky camera hand, I will do my best to get it on the tripod more often in the future.

Acrobatic killer whales and dolphinsWe had a great whale watching trip through Aboriginal Journeys of Campbell River, BC, Canada (http://www.aboriginaljourneys.com), on Aug. 15, 2013.  Garry Henkel really knows what he's doing in getting you ahead of the killer whales, and positioning the boat so you get the best possible view as they come towards you. After spending several hours with the Orcas, he took the group on a trip to see a pod of about 100 Pacific White Sided dolphins -- we travelled about 100 km over a six hour journey.  Our trip was a prize donated by Garry to the Wild Ocean Whales Society (WOWs) as a fund-raiser. Our enthusiastic thanks to him and to Susan MacKay of WOWs, who operates a wonderful volunteer website tracking whales and dolphins on the BC coast. You'll find it at http://whalesanddolphinsbc.com.  If you're interested in wild whales and dolphins, we urge you to support both Garry and Susan.  Joan and Soren Bech Roberts Creek, BC, Canada

This entire clip is normal speed. Chipmunks are FAST!

Highland Backpacking Trail - Algonquin ParkOn June 3rd, I drove up to Algonquin Provincial Park and did my first solo backpacking trip. This is day 1 hiking from the trailhead to Faya Lake. The trail starts with a fairly steep climb with lots of rocks and roots to trip over and hungry mosquitoes, gnats and deer flies. Faya Lake is an incredible campsite and it's actually the only campsite on the lake so you are totally secluded from any other hikers, not to mention it's beautiful. I highly recommend camping at Faya Lake but just don't forget bug spray! The stars at night were the highlight of my night there.   __  Instagram - http://instagram.com/reid_zed/    __  Music  "Hold" - Vera Blue  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cv6JEjevKQ "Is There a Ghost" - Band of Horses https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QremHCvOG-I "Wings" - Birdy  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJTXDCh2YiA  __  Shot with a Canon 6D & GoPro Hero3+ Black Edition.

Ausable Conservation Area - Free Personal DumpFor any inquiries on this issue, I can be contacted by leaving a common down below or sending me a personal message through this YouTube account.  ABOUT THE VIDEO: This is a video I have created in order to inform the local pubic about an issue that the Ausable Conservation Authority ignores. A local individual is using this protected conservation area space as personal dumping grounds for leaves, wood, grass clippings, old plants, dirt, household garbage, etc. They also use this space to grow their own personal plants and removes dirt for their personal usage. The conservation authority has been informed on numerous occasions, but no actions have been taken. This is located in Port Franks, Ontario, Canada.  MAIN FACTS -we have requested no dumping signs which they agreed to installed, but have not follow through with the request -there is a hole cut in the Conservation Area's fence in order to have direct access (shown in video) -there is various piles of this "debris" scattered throughout the Conservation Area, but the main pile is approx 100 feet long and 7 feet deep   WHY IS THIS A PROBLEM: -the Conservation Authority restricts the usage of motorized vehicles or horse, yet they ignore this dumping and the traffic of a wheelbarrow and a lawn tractor -there is protected vegetation in this Conservation Area, but the large amounts of "debris" is preventing the growth of this vegetation or killing any existing plants -these large leaf piles can cause a major safety hazard for the conservation area and risk the safety of the community around it -large leaf piles do create heat from natural rot, which does increase the risk of fires -this is an eyesore for the residence that lives near this and also to the individuals who hike through here

Fox at the dog food.wmvIn January, 2011, a hungry fox visits the Bell II Lodge in northwestern British Columbia, Canada, to steal some dog food from an unguarded dish. This is the dark colour phase of the common red fox, but this specimen has a white marking on its right hind leg, which may be the result of an old injury, -maybe a trap.
Killer Whales (Orca's) in Thulin Passage / Copeland Islands near Lund BCDuring a day-tour with Footprint Nature Explorations (Powell River / Lund BC) we encountered a group of killer whales.

Algonquin Wildlife - July 2011These are the highlights of the wildlife that we saw on our 4 day canoe trip over the July long weekend of 2011. We saw our first white tailed deer before even getting to the Shall Lake access point. On Shirley Lake we caught some lake trout, saw some loons, spotted a snapping turtle prowling the shore and watched a few butterflies. On Ryan Lake we caught a couple of brook trout and had a visit with a dragon fly. While touring Shall Lake we spotted a white tailed buck browsing under the hydro lines. Back on Crotch Lake I caught a nice smallmouth bass, we watched some more butterflies, found a garter snake and even got to see a beaver swimming back to his (her?) lodge.

Secrets of Salamanders at Cawthra Mulock Nature Reserve in Newmarket, OntarioOn a hot and steamy day in July, volunteers helped Ontario Nature set up a salamander monitoring study at Cawthra Mulock Nature Reserve in Newmarket, Ontario. Reserve stewards and teens from the YMCA Newcomer Youth Leadership Development program braved intense heat, stinging nettle and mosquitoes to place wooden planks on the ground in known salamander habitat.   Salamanders will use these planks as shelter next season, and volunteers will monitor this use to learn more about the salamander population in this reserve. Results will be shared with the Ontario Reptile and Amphibian Atlas: http://www.ontarionature.org/atlas   Ontario Nature thanks TD Friends of the Environment Foundation for supporting this project.

1975 Expedition from BWCAW to Hudson Bay in 26ft North Canoe1975 Expeditions of North America canoe trip starting at the end of the Gunlflint Trail on Saganaga Lake in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) to Hudson Bay, York Factory, and up the Nelson River in one North Canoe. This Expedition retraced Voyageur fur trade route along the US - Canadian border to Lake of the Woods, Winnipeg River to Lake Winnipeg, the Hayes River system into York Factory and Hudson Bay. Two Guide/Counselors and 7 teenagers paddled and carried the 350 pound wood and fiberglass 26 foot North Canoe the entire 1200 miles in 75 days, using only compass and US geologic maps, without cell phone or other electronic devices. Food canisters were packed and shipped ahead for resupply at International Falls, Kenora, Pine Falls and remote Hudson Bay stores in Norway House, Oxford House and York Factory. The group was wind-bound on an island in Lake Winnipeg for 5 days, but were able to secure additional provisions from local Cree residents at Berens River. Erik Sevareid's book, 'Canoeing With the Cree' was inspirational, and provided historical significance to the areas visited during the Expedition.

Boating At Henrys Fish Restaurant On Georgian BayA look around the 'World Famous' Henry's Fish Restaurant in the Sans Souci area of Georgian Bay. San Souci means 'without cares' and was the name given by Samuel de Champlain who was the first European explorer to visit, map and write about the area.   Located in the heart of the Thirty Thousand Islands, this place is only accessible by water, so visitors come in by boat and the numerous float planes that fly in. Not much to it, which is precisely why it is so popular. Boaters who wish to overnight here have access to shore power hookups and fresh water at the gas dock, although hey no longer sell fuel.   A great place to sit back, relax and give up one's cares :-)  Captured with Sony HXR-NX30U video camera & GoPro Hero 3  Location of this video (Henry's Restaurant): 45.17453 -80.13684  Filmed in July, 2015.

Fish and Sphinx: Illustrations by Rae BridgmanIt's a very fishy tale...  Wil Wychwood's magical medallion weighs heavily on him. For once, he would like to live a normal life. Tired of bearing the burden of the Serpent's Chain secret society, he plans to toss the medallion into the rising river waters. But when the mists reveal a new mystery, cousins Wil and Sophie tumble into the secret realm of Catfysh, the Spirit of the River, and a plot to destroy the most magical building in Canada.  In this adventure, the world of magical MiddleGate intersects with the Manitoba Legislature - the Palace of the Blazing Star - where stone sphinxes, bison, lions, snakes and goddesses protect an ancient mystery. Cousins Wil and Sophie follow secret signs, decode cryptic messages, and work to solve a riddle to unleash powerful allies locked in stone. But even if they succeed, will they ever escape from the trials of the ancient medallion? And what will be the cost of their secrets and lies? [Book III of The MiddleGate Books: www.raebridgman.ca]

Worst hell-hole on Earth 09 - the Alberta tar sands - Flying into a thunder storm.   (Anthony Marr - www.HOPE-CARE.org)Since water in vast quantities has to be drawn from the Athabasca River, the processing plants have to be near the river, and thus their toxins-laden (esp. PAHs) tailing "ponds".  The water of the river and the Athabasca Lake is so toxic that their fish are deformed, and moose meat is inedible. The native peoples feeding on them have developed sky-high cancer rates.  And Dr. O'Conner, who reported this, could have his medical license revoked for his whistle-blowing.
Sea WormSome kind of worm/caterpillar found in Sept-iles in Quebec, Canada. If anyone knows what this is, please post it out.
Connectivity - The Restoration of 40 Mile CreekThe 40 Mile Creek Dam once supplied Banff with drinking water and water to fight fires. Located between the two entrances to town, it was built in 1946, but hadn't been used as a water source since the mid-1980s. This project involved a partial removal of the dam structure to allow the water to flow freely, and removal of some exposed pipes.   The dam was decommissioned in May 2014. It was a joint project by the Town of Banff and Parks Canada with funding from the Province of Alberta. http://banff.ca/40milecreek
JEFF & BRENDA LEE LUTZ INVADE POLYNESIA...BORA BORA WILL NEVER BE THE SAME!THE GRISWOLDS COULD NOT HAVE LEFT A WIDER SWATH OF DESTRUCTION!!! This, our first youtube vid, was taped April 6-13, 2012. Most of it, including the fish "Feeding Frenzy" (ar, ar), was shot snorkeling under our bungalow No. 109 at Le Maitai resort. Jeff kayaked to the Sofitel private motu's coral gardens and did the rest there. Dunno where the stingray footage went. The GoPro Hero HD2 with a Blurfix adapter and URPro's SWCY filter did well in both clear and murky water. HD quality takes a big hit in Moviemaker and is also degraded in the upload. We have been spoiled by the Canon Vixia HV40, which basically allows us to burn the raw video straight to Blu-ray. Great cover tunes were chosen as a soundtrack but due to copyright infringement we utilized stuff Jeff had put down previously, mostly original tracks. A shout out to the great folks we met there...the Chicagoans / Serbians / Sicilians and  Albertans. The le Maitai staff are amazingly nice. This is a very special island and we will never forget it. Go Winnipeg Jets and Saskatchewan Roughriders!

RIPLEY'S AQUARIUM of CANADA TOUR!!!! (Fish Murder Too!!!) Toronto, OntarioWe tour Ripley's Aquarium of Canada in Toronto, Ontario for the first time! and see a fish get murdered...check it out!  ***SUBSCRIBE (If you want...I can't tell you how to live your life)*** Mike's Twitter https://twitter.com/mikekarschti Mike's Instagram https://instagram.com/mikekarschti Periscope: Mike Karschti Snapchat: mikekarschti ps. for those wondering how to pronounce my last name: Car-sh-tee  Ripley's Aquarium of Canada is a public aquarium in Toronto, Ontario. The aquarium is one of three aquariums owned and operated by Ripley Entertainment. It is located in downtown Toronto, just southeast of the CN Tower. The aquarium features several aquatic exhibits including a walk-through tank. The aquarium has 5.7 million litres (1.5 million gallons) of marine and freshwater habitats from across the world. The exhibits hold 13,500 exotic sea and freshwater specimens from more than 450 species. A Ripley's Aquarium was originally planned in 2004 to be built in Niagara Falls, Ontario[2] next to what is now Great Wolf Lodge around 2007, but plans fell through and Ripley's eventually relocated to Toronto.[3] Construction began on the attraction in August 2011 with a final cost approaching C$130 million. The aquarium opened to the public in October 2013.  The project was a partnership with three levels of government. The federal government's Canada Lands Company contributed $10 million to the project to develop the "John Street Corridor" linking Front Street with the aquarium, the CN Tower and the Rogers Centre. The Government of Ontario contributed $11 million to the project, and the City of Toronto provided property-tax incentives amounting to between $8 million and $12 million over the first twelve years of the aquarium.  Ripley's Aquarium has been the target of animal liberation groups such as TARA (Toronto Aquarium Resistance) and MAD (Marineland Animal Defence), which claim animal captivity is synonymous with animal abuse and regularly conduct protests and demonstrations at the facility. Prominent animal conservationist Bob Timmons has also publicly spoken out against Ripley Aquarium's capture of endangered tiger sharks. The aquarium holds 5.7 million litres (1.5 million gallons) of water and shows marine and freshwater habitats from around the world.[7] The aquarium is organized into nine galleries: Canadian Waters, Rainbow Reef, Dangerous Lagoon, Discovery Centre, The Gallery, Ray Bay, Planet Jellies, Life Support Systems and the Shoreline Gallery. It is home to 16,000 animals.  The Canadian Waters exhibit features animals from all the bodies of water surrounding the country. The gallery has 17 habitats. Some animals featured in this exhibit include: alewife, largemouth bass, American lobster, wolf eel, lump fish, giant pacific octopus, china rockfish The Rainbow Reef features animals from the Indo-Pacific water regions and is the most colourful gallery in the exhibit, hence its name. Some of the species in this exhibit include: Picasso triggerfish, humbug dascyllus, emperor angelfish, pajama cardinalfish, unicorn surgeonfish. The exhibit also features an interactive dive show.  The Dangerous Lagoon is an underwater tunnel with a moving side walk, which is the aquarium's largest tank. Some of the featured animals in this exhibit are: sand tiger shark, sandbar shark, roughtail stingray, green sawfish, green sea turtles. The Discovery Centre features various hands-on activities such as underwater viewing bubbles, a pop-up research submarine and a touch pool which allows visitors to touch living fossils. Discovery Centre inhabitants include: clownfish, palette surgeonfish, horseshoe crab, guineafowl puffer. The Touch exhibits give visitors the opportunity to touch the skins of various animals like sharks and sting-rays with the help of aquarium employees. This gallery is home to whitespotted bamboo sharks, brownbanded bamboo sharks, southern stingray, cownose rays. The Gallery exhibit, also known as Mother Nature's Art Gallery, features some of the most delicate underwater species from all over the world. This exhibit features the red lionfish, electric eel, lined seahorse, weedy sea dragon and the archerfish. This exhibit features six salt water and three fresh water exhibits. The Planet Jellies exhibit has colour changing displays with five species of jellyfish. These include: pacific sea nettle, moon jelly, spotted jelly, and upside-down jelly. The Ray Bay exhibit is focused around three distinct species of stingrays. Occasionally visitors can see aquarium divers feeding the stingrays during their daily interactive dive shows. Some of the inhabitants of this exhibit include the bonnethead shark, cownose ray, and the southern stingray.  The Life Support System gives visitors a behind the scenes look at the aquarium’s life support systems room. The building features the largest life support systems room of Ripley’s three aquariums. This gallery features equipment for Dangerous Reef and Ray Bay.
