Temagami Family trip. Canoe crash at Sturgeon River. Happy ending. 2015 We went to Temagami Provincial Park for the first time. Ahead of us was up to a week of paddling and camping in this part of Ontario. We started our tour happily at the top of Sturgeon River, and after a few meanders we saw a massive fallen tree blocking the river. The current was very strong, we couldn't manage to stop. We ended up broadside with the canoe sinking, luckily, to the right side of the river, paralel to the big tree trunk.  Everything went under the tree, the canoe, all the gear, ourselves...

Canoeing The North Saskatchewan River - Saskatchewan Crossing To Abraham Lake A day trip canoeing down the North Saskatchewan River.  Put-in near Saskatchewan Crossing, in Banff National Park, and took-out at Preacher's point, at the head of Abraham Lake.  The length of the trip was 35km, not 29km as stated in the video, my mistake.  Very nice scenery, and an enjoyable paddle.  Hope you enjoy.
French River Village Coponaning Ghost Town Saw Mill Alligator Ruins A trip to the French River area wouldn't be complete without a visit to the old Mill and Village Coponaning Town sites. The wreck symbols on the strip charts near buoy DC3  are supposedly from derelict "Alligator" tug boats left to die, all that remains are their boilers and pieces of tin. The area is now so overgrown it's difficult to piece together the mill site from a vintage low-res internet photo. Still lots of iron bits laying around, and portions of the original derelict steam engine. Anyone know the story about it?  Hard to imagine that a village of 1500 people at some point used to live here.

Waterway Tips #5 - Rice Lake Railway Cribbing When crossing Rice Lake along the Trent Severn Waterway (TSW), one must be aware of an ancient railway cribbing that straddles the lake close to the entrance of the Otonabee River. This railway cribbing was installed in the mid 1800's but suffered extensive ice damage and was abandoned after only six years of service.   There is a well marked spot to pass safely and is part of the main Small Craft Route that crosses in a east-west direction across the lake. Unfortunately, boaters who are unaware hit this obstruction every year - so keep an eye out for the markers and be aware of where you are!   Rice Lake is one of the largest lakes along the TSW, second only to Lake Simcoe.

The Trent-Severn Waterway The Trent-Severn Waterway has many interesting and unique methods for moving boats from one body of water to another. This time-lapse video demonstrates just some of the locks that can be found along the route from Lake Ontario at the Bay of Quinte to Georgian Bay.  Spending the summer visiting these locks, I was amazed by the engineering. Transfers are relatively quick, some as quick as 25 minutes for one sequence. This time-lapse video allows the visitor to see multiple transfers in just five minutes.  I have enjoyed "The Summer of Time Lapse". It reminds me of my film days. I would shoot a roll of 36 and then wait for the C-41 processing before I could see the images. The anticipation is similar with time-lapse, I have to wait for all of the images to be processed into a movie before I can see all the details and movement that I could not see while photographing the sequence.  Completed time-lapse sequences always surprise me, what is captured in the detail. Clouds would appear still during the shoot only to reveal their formation and movement in a time-lapse. Much like a macro image reveals microscopic detail, time-lapse photography reveals details of time and movement.  I have looked at many time-lapse movies by other Photographers. Some convey a serene or calm approach. Others get the “Holy Grail” day to night transition spot on. I love the added motion that moving the camera in some way brings. This movie only utilises the Ken Burns effect provided in iMovie.    I used a Nikon D7100 DSLR and the Triggertrap Mobile intervalometer on my iPad to trigger the camera. Most of the sequences were captured with intervals between 1 and 5 seconds. As the summer progressed, so did the capture settings. I went from Jpeg to Raw adding ND filters trying for the elusive 1/40, f3.5, and ISO 100.  I have invested in LRTimelapse and Adobe Lightroom for the digital darkroom. All sequences were rendered at 24 frames per second. The final movie was edited in iMovie.  Please let me know what you think in the comments below.

The Western Brook Pond Fjord / Gros Morne National Park Newfoundland The Western Brook Pond is a Canadian fjord or lake located in Gros Morne National Park on the west coast of the island of Newfoundland. It is in the Long Range Mountains, the most northern section of the Appalachian Mountains.    Rock wallsIt is surrounded by steep rock walls 600 m (2,000 ft) high. Having been carved from the surrounding plateau by glaciers. After the glaciers melted, the land rebounded and the fjord was cut off from the sea. Salty water was eventually flushed from the fjord leaving it fresh. The catchment area is composed of igneous rock with relatively thin soil, so the waters feeding Western Brook Pond are low in nutrients and the lake is classified as ultraoligotrophic. It is fed by Stag Brook at the extreme eastern end of the lake and by numerous waterfalls cascading from the plateau above. One of these, Pissing Mare Falls at 350 m (1,150 ft), is one of the highest in eastern North America.    The lake is accessible by a moderate-easy 3 km (1.9 mi) hiking trail over coastal bogs and low limestone ridges. Two tour boats, one with a capacity of 70 passengers and the other 90 passengers, cruise the lake from June to mid-October. The lake waters are pristine, having had very little impact from human activities. The tour boat operators had to undergo special certification to ensure that their operations would have minimal impact on the environment.    In the early part of the 20th century, a part of the surrounding cliff broke off and fell into the lake, causing a 30 m (98 ft) tsunami.

My Little Island Home Soong I wrote about the place in which I grew up... Here are the Lyrics as requested  My Little Island Home   How I long to see my Island,  The place that I was born,  To gaze upon her rocky shores,  And the places I once roamed.   To see the sun arisin',  over Snatches Cover to start the day  and﻿ then see her nestle down,  In slumber out o're the bay.   From the Northeast River's rapids  To the Southeast River's shores  To see Mount Pleasant shinin'  from the comfort of my door.  To the Seven Island island lookout To the﻿ "Lane" in July I long to see my home I don't know how i will get by  I'm comin home again I long for home again My island calls my name For her son to come back home  And If youve ever been there you'll love here just like me I dont know why I left there It was just the powers that be  And its only for a﻿ short while that I'll call Alberta home Because my heart longs to be On My Little Island Home

Red Deer, Alberta to Saskatchewan River Crossing, Alberta (Highway 11 Westbound) - time lapse During Easter weekend I made a couple of road trips around our province.  On the trip I tried to capture some of the scenic highways in the area.    This video is of a portion of Highway 11 from Red Deer, in central Alberta, to Saskatchewan Crossing on the Icefields Parkway.  The name Saskatchewan Crossing refers to the North Saskatchewan River which Highway 11 roughly follows West of Rocky Mountain House.    This route passes through the town of Rocky Mountain House which is named for an early trading fort of the Hudson's Bay Company.  It was established by an early explorer named David Thompson who did extensive mapping of the area West of Rocky mountain House and large portions of the mountains as far South as Washington state.  The Lewis and Clark expedition used some of Thompson's maps on their explorations.    The music used is Angels by Blue Rodeo.  This was filmed on April 5, 2010 at 20x real time.

Snowmobile Hillclimb on "The Onion", Smithers, 29 Dec 07 This was my introduction to the snowmobile hillclimb.

My dear uncle took it upon himself to raise the bar for the young punks, going through the rocks where there's not much snow. Hence the other rider opting out and looking over his shoulder in disbelief, while we all laughed our heads off!

Saskatchewan River Crossing, Alberta to Penhold, Alberta (Highway 11 Eastbound) - time lapse During Easter weekend I made a couple of road trips around our province.

I didn't go quite to Red Deer on the return trip, but left Highway 11 by Sylvan Lake and took the back roads home to Penhold.    This Highway cuts through a wide variety of terrain. It begins in the mountains near the continental divide, followed by the heavily treed foothills, and after Rocky Mountain House, the prairies.      The music used is Little Bones and At the Hundredth Meridian by The Tragically Hip.      This was filmed on April 5, 2010 at 20x real time.

Kamloops highlands in April A nice area to hike and geocache at Kamloops in my beautiful province of British Columbia.  To get here park your vehicle at the top of the hill on McGill Road, near the university.  It is a cold day towards the end of April, still feeling a little like winter.  The bit of color that comes with the moisture of winter and spring will soon be lost in the summer heat.  Looking to the west you can see the smoke stack from the pulp mill in the Mission Flats area of Kamloops, and in the photos towards the end of this slide show you can see the ponds from the pulp mill, as well as see the beginning of Kamloops Lake.

Lynx Capture ( recapture ) - Nancy Paw-losi To see more lynx videos go to lynxresearchers' channel.    This is one of our recaptures (January 15, 2008) on the Canada Lynx Project. She is a 22.5 pound female that we have named Nancy Paw-losi. She has put on 2 lbs since we collared her in November, and it suits her beautifully. We are tracking her movements near Rocky Mountain House and Nordegg Alberta, Canada.    If you are wondering why some of  the Lynx Videos are gone, it is because my parents borrowed my account to put up their videos. Now they have their own account.

Audio: Final Cloud by Kevin McLeod -  http://bit.ly/NNAtTA  This is not your National Geographic  photo essay of Bottlenose Dolphins and Blue Whales, but it definitely  shows our excitement. A family of Florida Gulf Bottlenose Dolphins playfully followed our boat wake on one trip. The St. Lawrence in Quebec gave us the Blue Whales. These ocean creatures are awesome and human friendly, although I sure, if they wanted to, could toss you around like a rubber ducky play toy. The Blue Whales literally surfaced within 15 feet from our rubber Zodiak - thrilling and exciting.   Blue Whales can grow to 100 feet (30 meters) long and weight around 200 tons. An adult Blue Whale can consume as much  as 4 tons of krill per day. The shocking part is that there's less than 5,000 Blue Whales left on our planet -- an endangered species.  They are fighting to survive.   Bottlenose Dolphins are the other extreme of the whale family, and even though they are not considered endangered, only 1 million of them left. To put that in perspective there are 7 billion of us humans.  The Bottlenose Dolphin grows to roughly 12 feet long and weighs about 1,400 pounds.   Enjoy and protect them. Take care of our oceans. Spread the word. We only have one chance.

Hundreds of Dolphins chasing The Cruise Ship Disney Wonder An amazing thing happened on the cruise ship Disney Wonder, a sunset stroll on the walking deck caused a chance encounter with a very large pod of dolphins.  There were dolphins everywhere!  The encounter lasted a little over a minute as the dolphins tired and could not maintain the 15 knot pace of The Disney Wonder cruising the Inside Passage of British Columbia on the way back from an Alaska Cruise enroute to Vancouver. The exact location was Robson Bight.

Board Recovery & Self Rescue A lengthy story to this vid... wind was ramping up as I pumped kites, I went through it all; 14/10 & 7m Rises. The 14 had a weak valve that finally gave way and the 10 had too many pin holes in the LE so next I rigged the 7m.     During play time Chris tells me he lost his board and that it's most likely across the bay. So... @ 3:12 is when that adventure starts. I end up finding it after having a fabulous lengthy downwinder, try to bring it back but the wind totally dies, and for good. I end up self rescuing with the 7m in tow but at least we got his board back. Damn good times and OR saves LF's ass.     Heading home the setting sun was poking through the trees, saw a nasty collision then entered the twin sails marking your arrival to Cold Lake.

It's a really great  way to take in the beauty of the Bay of Fundy  wow that was a really cool experience to kayak on the Bay of Fundy we went out to  the Three Sisters and the Sun magically came out and lit them up for us then as we  were paddling back the fog came and its really ominous very cool to just see it  rolling in almost we think that ghost ship is just around the corner  You can go for a hike after kayak as well  Cheers to a good day, Cheers  We're camping on the Bay of Fundy  We see some seals, be very quiet, be very quiet  Well there you have it the Three sisters behind me here at low tide is a very  cool time to be here you can see the base of them.  This is an excellent view of the Three Sisters and a Pillar!  I don't know why they don't call it the Four Sisters, it's the Three Sisters  The Three Sisters are a magnificent rock formation on the Bay of Fundy.  Local Mi'kmaq legend states that powerful god Glooscap  Turned his three sisters into stone when he  left the land and bade them to remain until his return  Behind me is Elephant Rock. It really looks like an elephant  When it's high tide you  can actually kayak right through that so we will be back.  So there's the elephant that we walked to earlier   now you can paddle through it. Incredible  Just shows the power of these tides.  The Bay of Fundy has the world's highest tides  moving more than 100 billion tons of water every six hours and 13 minutes  that's more flow than all the world's freshwater rivers combined.  The tides range 35 to 55 feet  Every Day

Tug Gulf Regent. Squamish River Offload. The clip opens at a rather dismal looking place in Howe sound. We were there to pick up one piece off equipment for Squamish. We offload at Squamish, the Squamish Chief can be seen in the background. clip ends leaving the river. The bulkhead were we offloaded was not suited to the cutaway ramp on the barge, but with a little more tide all went well. Most times we never new what the offload site was like till we got to there.
BC Ferries Daring Rescue of Man Overboard Original Footage.  People on the Powell River to Comox ferry said they saw the man jump from the upper deck.  The crew was quickly in the water to attempt a rescue but the motor of the zodial died.  They then had to put a second zodiak into the water to get to the man.  Luckily there was an ambulance crew on the ferry that tended to the man when he was brought back to the ferry.    Some said that he was a homeless man that jumped but the man himself said he fell (likely to avoid charges).  Police are investigating.

This  video starts loading at Finn Bay at mouth of the mouth of Rivers inlet, and continues to the upper reaches of Spiller Inlet were we load more logs, Most of our trips were put together this way. We filled in the gaps that the big boys couldn't pick up.... cost wise. Our loads usually consisted of several stops, so the barge was moved to differant sites till we got a full load south bound. Our missed load was picked up next time around. Check out Stryker Island video. My channel has been up for one year now and i appreciate the support from my subscibers. Cheers, Larry   ps.

Frozen, the Sea is frozen, but wait, what do I see out there, Awesome, amazing and incredible Looking to see what is going on across the road, and then getting a closer look at the great river that flows beyond the ice This Year has been colder than most and there has not been a big thaw or a storm capable of breaking-up the ice that has built-up with many successive extreme cold days/weeks. Even the tides have not broken-up the ice this Year, the flowing waters, mixed with ice are at the edge of where the eye can see. But with the use of deep zoom, I was able to capture the flow as it speeds along, far from shore, on the mighty St-Lawrence estuary (where the river becomes the gulf), here in Sainte-Anne-Des-Monts Quebec, on the Northern shore of the Gaspe peninsula.  merci de votre visionnement, prenez un petit moment afin de visiter https://www.youtube.com/user/danbythesea   Je vous invite a venir visitez mon site:  http://www.danbythesea.com/francais.html   thank you for watching,  take a moment to visit my YouTube page https://www.youtube.com/user/danbythesea  I invite you to visit my site: http://www.danbythesea.com/english.html

Scuba Dive at Isthmus Bay Rd near Lions Head Ont, Canada Renee and I had a nice shore dive at Lions Head Bridge across the road from 239 Isthmus Bay Rd (see the map on the video).  The path down is a little rocky, so you have to be careful.  There is very limited parking for a few vehicles only.  Water visibility and temperature was better than at Cedar Hill Park.  If you need restroom facilities the best thing to do is use the public restrooms at the beach in downtown Lions Head before you drive to the dive site.  Our dive went north (left) where bottom depth is greater than to the south (right).  Due to silt it may be a little murkier near the lake bottom.  Hope you enjoy the video.  Claude and Renee

RC CWR Swamp Boat Bayou Will and I loaded up the trailer with the swamp boat and head down to the bayou. We even got some crazy on board footage too. The boat looks awesome behind the TF2 and custom built camper, a perfect swamp look. The boat was a toy grade boat that has been modded to look this way, called the Work Boat. I replaced all the electronics to hobby grade electronics to get more speed out of it too. Thanks for watching and enjoy, Cheers.

RC CWR river run NQD jet boat Took the NQD Tear Into jet boat to kananaskis county to do some creek runs at Evan Thomas and Ribbon Creek. But we are still having some water flow issues and the creeks are more like rivers. But we still managed to find a few slower moving parts to give the jet boat a good test. We cant wait to get back in a few weeks, after the creeks slow down a bit and we have more options. None the less we had a blast racing the boat up and down the creeks rivers.

I was testing out the new AsiaTees upgrades on my deadbolt build. The truck handled awesome and the only thing I might have to do is add some weight to the back. With the hardbody and batt under the hood theres lots of weight up front but it does climb like a champ.

A snowmobile trip to the Gorge, Newfoundland and Labrador (by Peter Bull, Newfoundland) On March 15, 2011, I went with a group of snowmobilers on a ride to "the Gorge" Western Brook Pond, Gros Morne National Park. Conditions were perfect, unlike 11 days earlier when we had to turn back because of high winds and whiteout conditions (see my other Youtube video). Our 177km trip took us over groomed trails and beautiful backcountry. This ride takes you into Gros Morne National Park. Before you head in, you need to pick up a park pass and a snowmobile permit. Contact the park before heading in. Any group planning the trip should have an experienced guide to lead the way. At 700meters above sea level, conditions can change in minutes from blue sky to whiteouts. River that were frozen over 11 days before were open on this trip. The Gorge is one of the premier snowmoblie trips one can take anywere.
#5 Moricetown Canyon with Curtis Cunningham Today's daily Vlog (part of my daily Vlog challenge with Josh Blaha!) takes place in Moricetown, British Columbia, approximately a half hour's drive north of the town of Smithers.  Curtis Cunningham, regional photographer and my host during this two week stay in Smithers, has shot the canyon numerous times in various seasons and kindly leads the way for me today.  Any questions? Please leave them below and I'll pick some to answer in future daily vlogs :)
RC CWR Trailin with the new Boat trailer for the NDQ jet boat Custom build boat trailer from aluminium, pulled behind the custom build SCX-10 deadbolt. What a great combo and what a lot of fun. Will and I head out for some jet BOATIN and had a blast. The trailer worked awesome and looks darn good too, I must say. It was a fun build, I just looked at a couple pics of what I would like and came up with this. Its 3/8 by 1/2 C channel aluminium, cut and bent then screwed together. No welds in it at all. We already have another idea on the go for another build, its a little different and may take awhile. But if it works out it should be awesome. So stay tuned for more to come :-) Thanks for watching and enjoy, Cheers.

The trail that the wraith led the Warrior patrol guys one on, though the back country. Was a tough trial throw water, rivers and mud, but amazing scenery. The wraith and its driver passed throw without any trouble and the Kananaskis Country was safe for all to enjoy once again.

Nothing can beat the feeling of pride when a father and son team test drive a custom designed and built RC. No sooner do we finish a build, we are already talking and planning the next build. A hobby the whole family can enjoy and have fun with. Thank you for joining us on our builds and trail runs in and around Calgary. Thanks for watching and enjoy, please subscribe LIKE and comment.

RC CWR Stormy weather jet boating with NQD 757 Tear Into Will and I hit the waves at St. Mary's Lake for some epic jet boating. With some stormy weather fronts rolling through the valley, the waves and wind started to pick up. Making it very difficult  to stay upright and cruise the lake. If we jumped a wave and had our boat pointed into the wind it would just flip us over. Will has to make some deep water rescues. The one rescue mission Will had to swim out to rescue the boat and then realized that he could just stand up LOL.  Good times on the lake, thanks for watching and enjoy. Cheers.

RC CWR NQD Tear Into Jet Boat trails We loaded up the Jet boat on a trailer and head for the river to hit some rapids. Gotta love this boat for river crawlin and river rock jumping. The plastic guard on the intake was broken and we ended up sucking up some rocks and destroyed the prop again. Good thing I bought a pack of 6 replacement ones LOL. So back to the bench for some repairs and we will be good to go again. I'll have to figure out a good system to stop the rock issue but that should be easy enough. We did have to cut our river run a little short with the jet boat tho. Theres some other really cool spots down there that we want to hit, so hopefully we get back out there soon :-) As always thanks for watching and enjoy, Cheers.

Vallée des Fantômes/Valley of the Phantoms : Parc national des Monts-Valin Chaque année au sommet des Monts-Valin dans la région du Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Mère Nature crée des œuvres d'art dans la neige. De renommée provinciale, la Vallée de Fantômes est l'endroit par excellence pour partir en raquettes dans plus de 7 mètres de neige poudreuse. Une expérience hors de l'ordinaire.  Réalisation : Anne Kostalas      Mother Nature does some of her best artistic work each winter as she creates eerily wonderful shapes in the snow-covered trees in the Monts-Valin park in the Saguenay - Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec.  Snowshoe through up to 7 metres (22 feet) of snow and experience this incredible display of nature for yourself. Video production by:  Anne Kostalas

RC CWR losi trekker in Maui Wave Racer Losi Trail Trekker vrs Maui waves equals 2 dead trucks. This is my version of Urban Assault 6, called Ocean A-salt in Maui. I was away on vacation during the CTGs UA6 in a slightly warmer climate in Maui Hawaii. So I dedicate this video to all the boys and girls that turned out for CTGs UA6 in the -5C' weather to take on the streets of Calgary, while I was racing the ocean waving in plus 27C' weather, OH YA and the ocean WON. This was the last RC run of my vacation, do to some salt water issues and electronics LOL. I knew it was going to happen, I always have to push the limits. I don't know for sure but I believe I blow 1 ESC in one rig and some gearing problems in the other. Alittle TLC and I'm sure they will be back hitting the trails in Calgary soon. Thanks for watching and enjoy.

RC CWR AngerOffRoadRC trail run Barry from @anger_rc or Angeroffroadrc, Birthday trail run (Happy Birthday bud) so we hit the trails at Ribbon Creek. The boys that do the angeroffroadrc trail run put on lots and lots of miles, luckily today they took easy on us old and sore guys. Tod and I ended up leaving earlier but the boys continued on up the mountain. We still need to cook up the hotdogs on the campfire, next time. Make sure to check out the boys Instagram pages, for some awesome RC pics, @anger_rc @chaz_rc @calgary_p3ngu1in and of course @voodoo_44. The boys are fast and its a little hard to get some good footage of them. So this is what I managed to get of todays trail crew.

A snowmobile trail ride from Steady Brook to Deer Lake, Newfoundland and Labrador (by Peter Bull) Early in March 2012, I took a two hour snowmobile ride from Steady Brook to Deer Lake. A fantastic day of riding on the groomed trails of the Newfoundland and Labrador Snowmobile Federation. Western Snowriders and Junction Trail Blazers share this trail. There was some forestry operations but for the most part, it was a fantastic ride through rolling, twisting trail.
Creepy squatter cabin hidden in Alberta prairies Skidooing far into the prairies of Alberta and found this cabin in a group of trees about 30km from the nearest road. The wood burning stove was still hot. Looks to be somebodys hideout. There were no other snowmobile trails in or out of the area.

RC CWR Boats, Boats and more Boats Miss Geico, BlackJack, Mini Mono, IOM sailboats, Tear Into Jet boats and a bunch of other boats. Chris from ARCH (Alberta RC Handbook) set up a - Let's go boating - day at Pine Coulee lake south of Calgary. We must of had a dozen drivers and close to twenty boats. What a great way to spend the day, with a bunch fellow RC guys racing boats on the water on a beautiful summer day. Some of the boats videoed very well and some not so much LOL. The Mini Monos are fast little darts on the water that are very hard to follow with the camera, a blast to drive, watch and race tho. And of course we had a few trucks out and about too. Everybody helping everybody fixing boats, rescuing boats, Aaron aka rookie101 even went for a long swim to help a few boats. Thanks to Lyle for helping and grabbing the camera to catch some rescue missions on film. It always a good time with these greta bunch of RC guys, links below so make sure to check them out.

RC CWR snow baotin journey Down a Frozen River The axial honcho 6X6 hauling the trailer with the Blackjack the snow boating boat in tow. We got some AWESOME on board footage this time with the Go Pro, as went flying down the snow covered river bed. It was a chilly -29 C' when we started and warmed up to -27 C' by the end LOL. But we were sweating like crazy, trudging through knee to waist deep snow for almost 2 hours. We had a blast out there on our chilly snow boatin journey. Thanks for watching and enjoy, hopefully we can get back to this spot for some Super Cub flying. I want to shot down the river bed lined with trees and fly under the bridge and cut it hard up and out.

RC CWR TeamRaffee Co. trailer trail run with RC4WD Gelande 2 I took the Team Raffee Company trailer out for a trail run with Todd the red TF2 and Grant gray Gelande II FJ. I was pulling the new trailer behind my yellow Gelande II D-90. I also used the BoomRacing 10 mm wheel wideners for the trailer to give it a wider stance. Then I strapped down my Losi Trail Trekker Quad and off we went for a 4 hour trail hike. The trailer is built and looks amazing, this is the same chassis that I built my extreme off-road trailer on. It is a great trailer to build off of or just strap down some cargo and hit the trails. As always thanks for watching and enjoy, Cheers.

Free salt giveaway causes chaos at Vancouver fire station Piles of salt arrived at several Vancouver, BC fire stations and it took only a matter of minutes before it was all gone. Anxious residents made a mad dash with shovels to fill their allotment of one small bucket of salt before it all disappeared. The City of Vancouver’s offer of free salt to deal with icy roads and sidewalks created massive line-ups at fire halls around the city.  The ice melting product was in short supply following a stretch of unusually cold weather.

The Geese of Lake Beaumaris In an established neighbourhood in Edmonton, Alberta is a rather large and beautiful man-made lake called Lake Beaumaris. In the fall of 2010, thousands of geese have stopped at Lake Beaumaris on their migratory path.

Pack of Wild Eastern Wolves in Algonquin Provincial Park (www.algonquinpark.on.ca) This video shows a pack of 7 wild Eastern Wolves in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada.  Watch as the dominant wolf feeds upon the White-tailed Deer carcass and the other pack members interact.  More dominant animals (holding their tails high when interacting) dominate subordinate pack members (holding their tails between their legs).  At one point a more dominant animal "pins down" a subordinate wolf who "relaxes" until the other wolf departs.  Common Ravens (the numerous birds) await their opportunity to scavenge for a meal throughout the duration of the video.  This is a sight rarely recorded.  Only 5 five wolves are visible at one time, but the whole pack of 7 is in the valley out of the camera's frame.    To learn more about wolves and wolf research in Algonquin Park check: http://www.algonquinpark.on.ca and http://www.sbaa.ca    Recorded from the Algonquin Park Visitor Centre viewing deck on Thursday, February 18, 2010 by Park Staff.

Saskatchewan Landing Provincial Park Wildlife 2008 This is my first vid and hopefully many more will follow.  This is not a music vid rather a bunch of wildlife footage with a tune added.  I figured music was better than the useless garble my colleagues and I rambled about.  The pheasant I was watching all summer long but only had one opportunity to catch it on camera.  I was hoping to get a bull snake mimicking a prairie rattler.  Hopefully I will get the footage this summer, it is an awesome thing to witness.  Anyways I hope you all enjoy my shaky camera hand, I will do my best to get it on the tripod more often in the future.

Acrobatic killer whales and dolphins We had a great whale watching trip through Aboriginal Journeys of Campbell River, BC, Canada (http://www.aboriginaljourneys.com), on Aug. 15, 2013.  Garry Henkel really knows what he's doing in getting you ahead of the killer whales, and positioning the boat so you get the best possible view as they come towards you. After spending several hours with the Orcas, he took the group on a trip to see a pod of about 100 Pacific White Sided dolphins -- we travelled about 100 km over a six hour journey.  Our trip was a prize donated by Garry to the Wild Ocean Whales Society (WOWs) as a fund-raiser. Our enthusiastic thanks to him and to Susan MacKay of WOWs, who operates a wonderful volunteer website tracking whales and dolphins on the BC coast. You'll find it at http://whalesanddolphinsbc.com.  If you're interested in wild whales and dolphins, we urge you to support both Garry and Susan.  Joan and Soren Bech Roberts Creek, BC, Canada

Highland Backpacking Trail - Algonquin Park On June 3rd, I drove up to Algonquin Provincial Park and did my first solo backpacking trip. This is day 1 hiking from the trailhead to Faya Lake. The trail starts with a fairly steep climb with lots of rocks and roots to trip over and hungry mosquitoes, gnats and deer flies. Faya Lake is an incredible campsite and it's actually the only campsite on the lake so you are totally secluded from any other hikers, not to mention it's beautiful. I highly recommend camping at Faya Lake but just don't forget bug spray! The stars at night were the highlight of my night there.   __  Instagram - http://instagram.com/reid_zed/    __  Music  "Hold" - Vera Blue  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Cv6JEjevKQ "Is There a Ghost" - Band of Horses https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QremHCvOG-I "Wings" - Birdy  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJTXDCh2YiA  __  Shot with a Canon 6D & GoPro Hero3+ Black Edition.

Ausable Conservation Area - Free Personal Dump For any inquiries on this issue, I can be contacted by leaving a common down below or sending me a personal message through this YouTube account.  ABOUT THE VIDEO: This is a video I have created in order to inform the local pubic about an issue that the Ausable Conservation Authority ignores. A local individual is using this protected conservation area space as personal dumping grounds for leaves, wood, grass clippings, old plants, dirt, household garbage, etc. They also use this space to grow their own personal plants and removes dirt for their personal usage. The conservation authority has been informed on numerous occasions, but no actions have been taken. This is located in Port Franks, Ontario, Canada.  MAIN FACTS -we have requested no dumping signs which they agreed to installed, but have not follow through with the request -there is a hole cut in the Conservation Area's fence in order to have direct access (shown in video) -there is various piles of this "debris" scattered throughout the Conservation Area, but the main pile is approx 100 feet long and 7 feet deep   WHY IS THIS A PROBLEM: -the Conservation Authority restricts the usage of motorized vehicles or horse, yet they ignore this dumping and the traffic of a wheelbarrow and a lawn tractor -there is protected vegetation in this Conservation Area, but the large amounts of "debris" is preventing the growth of this vegetation or killing any existing plants -these large leaf piles can cause a major safety hazard for the conservation area and risk the safety of the community around it -large leaf piles do create heat from natural rot, which does increase the risk of fires -this is an eyesore for the residence that lives near this and also to the individuals who hike through here

Fox at the dog food.wmv In January, 2011, a hungry fox visits the Bell II Lodge in northwestern British Columbia, Canada, to steal some dog food from an unguarded dish. This is the dark colour phase of the common red fox, but this specimen has a white marking on its right hind leg, which may be the result of an old injury, -maybe a trap.
Killer Whales (Orca's) in Thulin Passage / Copeland Islands near Lund BC During a day-tour with Footprint Nature Explorations (Powell River / Lund BC) we encountered a group of killer whales. They suddenly changed direction and came swimming towards us. Shortly after they started breaching, spy hopping and tail-slapping.
Algonquin Wildlife - July 2011 These are the highlights of the wildlife that we saw on our 4 day canoe trip over the July long weekend of 2011. We saw our first white tailed deer before even getting to the Shall Lake access point. On Shirley Lake we caught some lake trout, saw some loons, spotted a snapping turtle prowling the shore and watched a few butterflies. On Ryan Lake we caught a couple of brook trout and had a visit with a dragon fly. While touring Shall Lake we spotted a white tailed buck browsing under the hydro lines. Back on Crotch Lake I caught a nice smallmouth bass, we watched some more butterflies, found a garter snake and even got to see a beaver swimming back to his (her?) lodge.
Orca's West Coast Canada Baby Orca Sunshine Coast BC Here are some still shots and some video of a pod of orcas that passed through the inlet.  It is a small family and you can see the baby orcas testing out the jumping skills.  It was quite an entertaining show they put on.
Secrets of Salamanders at Cawthra Mulock Nature Reserve in Newmarket, Ontario On a hot and steamy day in July, volunteers helped Ontario Nature set up a salamander monitoring study at Cawthra Mulock Nature Reserve in Newmarket, Ontario. Reserve stewards and teens from the YMCA Newcomer Youth Leadership Development program braved intense heat, stinging nettle and mosquitoes to place wooden planks on the ground in known salamander habitat.   Salamanders will use these planks as shelter next season, and volunteers will monitor this use to learn more about the salamander population in this reserve. Results will be shared with the Ontario Reptile and Amphibian Atlas: http://www.ontarionature.org/atlas   Ontario Nature thanks TD Friends of the Environment Foundation for supporting this project.

1975 Expedition from BWCAW to Hudson Bay in 26ft North Canoe 1975 Expeditions of North America canoe trip starting at the end of the Gunlflint Trail on Saganaga Lake in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) to Hudson Bay, York Factory, and up the Nelson River in one North Canoe. This Expedition retraced Voyageur fur trade route along the US - Canadian border to Lake of the Woods, Winnipeg River to Lake Winnipeg, the Hayes River system into York Factory and Hudson Bay. Two Guide/Counselors and 7 teenagers paddled and carried the 350 pound wood and fiberglass 26 foot North Canoe the entire 1200 miles in 75 days, using only compass and US geologic maps, without cell phone or other electronic devices. Food canisters were packed and shipped ahead for resupply at International Falls, Kenora, Pine Falls and remote Hudson Bay stores in Norway House, Oxford House and York Factory. The group was wind-bound on an island in Lake Winnipeg for 5 days, but were able to secure additional provisions from local Cree residents at Berens River. Erik Sevareid's book, 'Canoeing With the Cree' was inspirational, and provided historical significance to the areas visited during the Expedition.

Boating At Henrys Fish Restaurant On Georgian Bay A look around the 'World Famous' Henry's Fish Restaurant in the Sans Souci area of Georgian Bay. San Souci means 'without cares' and was the name given by Samuel de Champlain who was the first European explorer to visit, map and write about the area.   Located in the heart of the Thirty Thousand Islands, this place is only accessible by water, so visitors come in by boat and the numerous float planes that fly in. Not much to it, which is precisely why it is so popular. Boaters who wish to overnight here have access to shore power hookups and fresh water at the gas dock, although hey no longer sell fuel.   A great place to sit back, relax and give up one's cares :-)  Captured with Sony HXR-NX30U video camera & GoPro Hero 3  Location of this video (Henry's Restaurant): 45.17453 -80.13684  Filmed in July, 2015.

Fish and Sphinx: Illustrations by Rae Bridgman It's a very fishy tale...    Wil Wychwood's magical medallion weighs heavily on him. For once, he would like to live a normal life. Tired of bearing the burden of the Serpent's Chain secret society, he plans to toss the medallion into the rising river waters. But when the mists reveal a new mystery, cousins Wil and Sophie tumble into the secret realm of Catfysh, the Spirit of the River, and a plot to destroy the most magical building in Canada.    In this adventure, the world of magical MiddleGate intersects with the Manitoba Legislature - the Palace of the Blazing Star - where stone sphinxes, bison, lions, snakes and goddesses protect an ancient mystery. Cousins Wil and Sophie follow secret signs, decode cryptic messages, and work to solve a riddle to unleash powerful allies locked in stone. But even if they succeed, will they ever escape from the trials of the ancient medallion? And what will be the cost of their secrets and lies? [Book III of The MiddleGate Books: www.raebridgman.ca]

Worst hell-hole on Earth 09 - the Alberta tar sands - Flying into a thunder storm.   (Anthony Marr - www.HOPE-CARE.org) Since water in vast quantities has to be drawn from the Athabasca River, the processing plants have to be near the river, and thus their toxins-laden (esp. PAHs) tailing "ponds".  The water of the river and the Athabasca Lake is so toxic that their fish are deformed, and moose meat is inedible. The native peoples feeding on them have developed sky-high cancer rates.  And Dr. O'Conner, who reported this, could have his medical license revoked for his whistle-blowing.

Connectivity - The Restoration of 40 Mile Creek The 40 Mile Creek Dam once supplied Banff with drinking water and water to fight fires. Located between the two entrances to town, it was built in 1946, but hadn't been used as a water source since the mid-1980s. This project involved a partial removal of the dam structure to allow the water to flow freely, and removal of some exposed pipes.   The dam was decommissioned in May 2014. It was a joint project by the Town of Banff and Parks Canada with funding from the Province of Alberta. http://banff.ca/40milecreek
JEFF & BRENDA LEE LUTZ INVADE POLYNESIA...BORA BORA WILL NEVER BE THE SAME! THE GRISWOLDS COULD NOT HAVE LEFT A WIDER SWATH OF DESTRUCTION!!! This, our first youtube vid, was taped April 6-13, 2012. Most of it, including the fish "Feeding Frenzy" (ar, ar), was shot snorkeling under our bungalow No. 109 at Le Maitai resort. Jeff kayaked to the Sofitel private motu's coral gardens and did the rest there. Dunno where the stingray footage went. The GoPro Hero HD2 with a Blurfix adapter and URPro's SWCY filter did well in both clear and murky water. HD quality takes a big hit in Moviemaker and is also degraded in the upload. We have been spoiled by the Canon Vixia HV40, which basically allows us to burn the raw video straight to Blu-ray. Great cover tunes were chosen as a soundtrack but due to copyright infringement we utilized stuff Jeff had put down previously, mostly original tracks. A shout out to the great folks we met there...the Chicagoans / Serbians / Sicilians and  Albertans. The le Maitai staff are amazingly nice. This is a very special island and we will never forget it. Go Winnipeg Jets and Saskatchewan Roughriders!

RIPLEY'S AQUARIUM of CANADA TOUR!!!! (Fish Murder Too!!!) Toronto, Ontario We tour Ripley's Aquarium of Canada in Toronto, Ontario for the first time! and see a fish get murdered...check it out!  ***SUBSCRIBE (If you want...I can't tell you how to live your life)*** Mike's Twitter https://twitter.com/mikekarschti Mike's Instagram https://instagram.com/mikekarschti Periscope: Mike Karschti Snapchat: mikekarschti ps. for those wondering how to pronounce my last name: Car-sh-tee  Ripley's Aquarium of Canada is a public aquarium in Toronto, Ontario. The aquarium is one of three aquariums owned and operated by Ripley Entertainment. It is located in downtown Toronto, just southeast of the CN Tower. The aquarium features several aquatic exhibits including a walk-through tank. The aquarium has 5.7 million litres (1.5 million gallons) of marine and freshwater habitats from across the world. The exhibits hold 13,500 exotic sea and freshwater specimens from more than 450 species. A Ripley's Aquarium was originally planned in 2004 to be built in Niagara Falls, Ontario[2] next to what is now Great Wolf Lodge around 2007, but plans fell through and Ripley's eventually relocated to Toronto.[3] Construction began on the attraction in August 2011 with a final cost approaching C$130 million. The aquarium opened to the public in October 2013.  The project was a partnership with three levels of government. The federal government's Canada Lands Company contributed $10 million to the project to develop the "John Street Corridor" linking Front Street with the aquarium, the CN Tower and the Rogers Centre. The Government of Ontario contributed $11 million to the project, and the City of Toronto provided property-tax incentives amounting to between $8 million and $12 million over the first twelve years of the aquarium.  Ripley's Aquarium has been the target of animal liberation groups such as TARA (Toronto Aquarium Resistance) and MAD (Marineland Animal Defence), which claim animal captivity is synonymous with animal abuse and regularly conduct protests and demonstrations at the facility. Prominent animal conservationist Bob Timmons has also publicly spoken out against Ripley Aquarium's capture of endangered tiger sharks. The aquarium holds 5.7 million litres (1.5 million gallons) of water and shows marine and freshwater habitats from around the world.[7] The aquarium is organized into nine galleries: Canadian Waters, Rainbow Reef, Dangerous Lagoon, Discovery Centre, The Gallery, Ray Bay, Planet Jellies, Life Support Systems and the Shoreline Gallery. It is home to 16,000 animals.  The Canadian Waters exhibit features animals from all the bodies of water surrounding the country. The gallery has 17 habitats. Some animals featured in this exhibit include: alewife, largemouth bass, American lobster, wolf eel, lump fish, giant pacific octopus, china rockfish The Rainbow Reef features animals from the Indo-Pacific water regions and is the most colourful gallery in the exhibit, hence its name. Some of the species in this exhibit include: Picasso triggerfish, humbug dascyllus, emperor angelfish, pajama cardinalfish, unicorn surgeonfish. The exhibit also features an interactive dive show.  The Dangerous Lagoon is an underwater tunnel with a moving side walk, which is the aquarium's largest tank. Some of the featured animals in this exhibit are: sand tiger shark, sandbar shark, roughtail stingray, green sawfish, green sea turtles. The Discovery Centre features various hands-on activities such as underwater viewing bubbles, a pop-up research submarine and a touch pool which allows visitors to touch living fossils. Discovery Centre inhabitants include: clownfish, palette surgeonfish, horseshoe crab, guineafowl puffer. The Touch exhibits give visitors the opportunity to touch the skins of various animals like sharks and sting-rays with the help of aquarium employees. This gallery is home to whitespotted bamboo sharks, brownbanded bamboo sharks, southern stingray, cownose rays. The Gallery exhibit, also known as Mother Nature's Art Gallery, features some of the most delicate underwater species from all over the world. This exhibit features the red lionfish, electric eel, lined seahorse, weedy sea dragon and the archerfish. This exhibit features six salt water and three fresh water exhibits. The Planet Jellies exhibit has colour changing displays with five species of jellyfish. These include: pacific sea nettle, moon jelly, spotted jelly, and upside-down jelly. The Ray Bay exhibit is focused around three distinct species of stingrays. Occasionally visitors can see aquarium divers feeding the stingrays during their daily interactive dive shows. Some of the inhabitants of this exhibit include the bonnethead shark, cownose ray, and the southern stingray.  The Life Support System gives visitors a behind the scenes look at the aquarium’s life support systems room. The building features the largest life support systems room of Ripley’s three aquariums. This gallery features equipment for Dangerous Reef and Ray Bay.
