Voices of Bute Inlet (part 1 of 2)Bute Inlet is on the front line for corporate greenwash and environmental devastation.This wilderness is threatened by a mammoth industrial power project under the guise of "green power".Private companies are running amok in BC, staking claim to creeks and rivers for private power generation.Bute inlet, known as BC's Himalayas, has been staked by Plutonic Power and General Electric for a proposed 1,000 Megawatt project which would put 17 rivers into pipes.Home to the last sustainable population of grizzly bears on the coast, "supernatural BC" stands to lose a gem of it's crown, and public control of it's power assets...

Survival heating tool "FIREWAALL-003" made in CanadaDesign by SPORTES inc. Copyright 2016  100% made in CanadaPre order on our web site www.sportesoutdoortools@gmail.com''FIREWAAL with two ''A'' 'because we burn wood Better outdoors''   The FIREWAALL-003 is an outdoor heating wood-burning tool for one to two people camping or surviving in nature.Compact and movable, it plays the role of raised rack + wood distributor and heat reflector to the fireplace.• 100% made in Canada• 3/32 "thick laser cut / folded Stainless steel 304L • 4,5 Lb • Width 13 inches x 13,25 inches High• Four main components:1 perforated base plate / combustion chamber1 separator / wood rack2 structural legs and dividers / wood rackHISTORYWe observed that some extreme campers (Bushcrafters) erected a wooden wall stacked horizontally behind their campfire to reflect the heat towards them.This method, apparently inspired by the sheet metal or the bricks at the back of the stoves and internal fireplaces, seemed laborious to implement. Problems such as the significant upwards heat loss upward (usual on a campfire to the ground) added to the complexity and time of erecting a 'wall' behind the fire made no sense.FEATURES• No tools required• NO contact between floor and fire• Oppportunity to make fire in any outdoor environment and conditions• Self-feeding wood log supply by gravity• Optimization of energy efficiency by reflecting heat and light• Orientability of the fire depending on wind direction • Optimization of the oxygen supply during combustion• Mobility of the fire rack The efficiency of combustion and the fluidity of gravity feeding of wood is extremely efficient and requires little effort.Unlike a traditional fireplace open to the ground, the user does not have to blow the fireplace and go all around the pitt to push the burnt wood down to the center so the fire does not go out .The FIREWAALL-003 has been designed to provide:• More heat• More light• More combustion• Less handling CREDITS:Host :         Cedric Sportes / founder SPORTES incDirection :  Christophe TerradeEditing :      Maxime Dumont Music:        GOODMAN by Futuro Pelo (benjamin sportes) Copyright 2016.

Ren Neo and Leo at Whistler Optimist Sailing Camp  july 2011The boys sailed for 5 days at Whistler Sailing association on Alta lake in Whistler. The class photo was doodled on by Leo I was going to blur there faces out for privacy concerns but he said he had a better idea . It was Rens 13th birthday and I got him a water proof video camera so the beginning footage is quite dodgy as they have never used is before.Ren really excelled at this sport I think there is so much the same as riding hands motion balance core strength and so on . His coach said Ren is in the top 3 of the fastest learners he has ever seen in sailing . after 5 days Ren is onto his White sail 3 and will be training for some races.. He is so stoked !!!!!!!!!Neo was using the camera the most as his weight was so little it made the boat handling quiet hard for him .At 6:18 Rens coach starts filming a little run with Ren he looks pretty good for the little time he has been on the water sailing He almost capsizes once but does a quiet recovery . At the end of the Video is Zen being the center of attraction and his sailing class sings happy birthday

Princess Louisa Inlet - British Columbia (trailer)Princess Louisa Inlet is a remote place on the west coast of British Columbia, is a mere gap of six kilometres long and just a few hundred meters wide and may possibly be be one of the most beautiful places on earth. It can only be reached by boat or float plane at the tip of the long body of water called Jervis Inlet.In 1919 a young man named James MacDonald discovered, fell in love and filed for ownership of the lands  surrounding the inlet, with Chatterbox Falls at it's head. In 1953 MacDonald transferred ownership of these land to the Princess Louisa International Society. The sheer cliffs rise a mile high, straight from the water. All around is the thick rainforest; the trees are tall and their trunks are covered with greeny/blue moss. The forest glades are deeply shaded and one half expects gnomes, elves and fairies to arrear from around the trees. The tweeting and chattering of the birds are constant. It is a truly magical place, restful and tranquil. Everyone should be fortunate enough to see Princess Louisa Inlet, the Princess as MacDonald referred to it, at least once in their lives.

Sailboat Ran Aground at White Rock PierAfter a regatta a skipper unfamiliar with the very narrow channel at the White Rock Pier in BC went too wide and ran aground with 5 people on board.No one was injured, and the sailboat wasn't damaged, but it was an ebb tide, which meant the water lever was dropping and would strand the boat even further as the tide went out.The challenge was to free the sailboat from the sand ledge as soon as possible before it rolled on its side and took on water.The LYMC.ca - Lower Mainland Yacht Club moors their fleet at this pier and a number of its members and experienced sailors were on hand working to tow the grounded sailboat free. Some of them had raced in the regatta that day.Easy fixes were tried first, like rocking the grounded sailboat and pulling it by hand with lines from the dock, but the keel was wedged in the sand too tight.A second plan to use a catamaran called "BAD KITTY" and to use a winch on "Lightcure" were quickly put in place.Bad Kitty attached a tow line to the halyard of the grounded sailboat with the intent of pulling the top of the mast over freeing the keel from the sand, while simultaneously a line was attached to the starboard winch of Lightcure that would pull the bow of the grounded boat forward.While the grounded sailboat was being towed from both points, it gunned its engine to assist in being freed.It was an interesting exercise demonstrating why speed and teamwork are critical in rescue operations.This is a good example for training purposes, but keep in mind all situations are different and this might not be the right or safe solution for you.Video shot and produced by Area46 Media Communicationshttp:// www.Area46.com

Sailing Bute Inlet, B.C. SlideshowThis is a 35 mile solo cruise up Bute Inlet (British Columbia) to Waddington Harbor at it's head July 9-10, 2015.  The inlet is long, wide, and uniformly very deep without any recommended or desirable anchorages along the way.  I experienced no advantage going up with the tide and winds were lite.  My single night at Waddington Harbor was peaceful as not another soul was there as well as no AM, FM, VHF radio, and very poor reception on SSB.  The return trip was against the tide and 25-28K winds gusting to 34K resulting in speed as low as 2.4K; turning around was not an option for fear of losing the rubber dinghy.  It was an almost 12 hour duty day at the helm to a suitable anchorage outside Bute at Von Donop Inlet.Photos were taken with a Sony Bloggie MHS-TS20.Music is Seeger by John Deley and the 41 players from the YouTube library.

Susan Hood Trophy Race 2011 StormAfter 15 hours of calm sailing in the Susan Hood Trophy Race we were hit by a thunderstorm Saturday morning out in the middle of Lake Ontario. This is a short clip of us pulling down sails as the wind blows us dead down wind at close to 10 knots.  We were barely in control and any attempts to sail into the wind would just put us over on our side.  Pretty wild ride.

Joffre Lakes Provincial Park Hike to Matier GlacierJoffre Lakes Provincial Park is about 3 hours from Vancouver, just past Pemberton. One weekend, my wife, a friend and I drove along the Sea-to-Sky Highway to Joffre Lakes Provincial Park. The trail at Joffre passes three lakes, each a striking, saturated turquoise blue. We quickly approached the first lake and observed U-shaped valleys, jagged peaks, silt and lateral moraines created by Matier Glacier perched atop Joffre Peak. We emerged into a clearing shortly past the first lake where the valley opened up to display a million shades of green. Inexperienced hikers might have difficulty crossing piles of boulders at this most rugged section of the trail. For most of the trek we were in the presence of a powerful, churning mountain stream. We crossed it several times on crude bridges made of fallen logs. At the end of the trail we arrived at the majestic Matier Glacier where some hikers camped overnight. Waterfalls spewed from the glacier carrying blue silt, which colored the lakes below.
ManigotaganPaddling 70 kms of quiet, picturesque stretches of water that glides through boreal and deciduous forests, is turned to adventure when interrupted by spectacular rapids and falls. Manigotagan River Provincial Park  in Manitoba, Canada features impressive topography ranging from sheer rockfaces topped with craggy lichen and Jack Pine, to impressive stretches of Balsam Poplar, Elderberry and Green Ash. The Manigotagan River, meaning "bad throat", was long ago named by a group of hunters who when calling game were answered by an old bull moose with a garbled throat. The old bull may be long gone, but the tranquil spirit of the river can still catch you by surprise.Filmed by: Michael Farrugia & Greg KlarDate: July 2011Camera: Nikon D5100, Nikon D3100, GoPro HDwww.FFDocs.org

Solo 3-day backpacking hike in Banff Rocky MountainsSolo 40 km backpack hike to Howse pass in Banff Park, Alberta.  This is an abandoned fur trading route.  I show tricks for making life easy in the wilderness. The trail was in such bad shape, with so much deadfall, that I had to abandon my attempt to reach the pass. Check out Brian Patton's blog on this trail at: http://canadianrockiestrailguide.com/howse-pass-the-disappearing-trail/  He's one of the co-authors of my favorite hiking book "The Canadian Rockies Trail Guide".Best part of making these video (other than the hike) is matching music.  For this video I used:1:50 Instrumental version of Madonna's "Amazing" found on YouTube.7:20 Instrumental version of the Tragically Hip's "Wheat King" found on YouTube.  The Hip are an amazing Canadian band from Ontario.15:10 Instrumental version of Collective Soul's "Shine".  Done by Nick Scott.

Backcountry 2011 - Island Lake Canoe Route720P Is best quality. 1080P has blur to it. Completed a trip into Island Lake Forest and Barrens Provincial Conservation Reserve on the Canada day long weekend. This Conservation Reserve is 45 minutes north of Parry Sound and access is via Wahwashkesh Lake. Ontario Headed up farm creek and camped on Wolf Lake for the first night, then continued into Dutton Lake and back to Island Lake for our final night. the route to Island Lake is fairly straight forward with easy portages, however when exploring the other lakes, portages can be rough to non-existent. Take caution when locating the portages between the small lake north of Wolf towards Dutton and the longer portage from the small lake East of Dutton into Island Lake. (the latter is riddled with multiple blazed  snowmobile and ATV trails, and there are about 5 portages blazed through here. The most straight forward is flagged and spray-painted orange. NOTE: Take the landing on the South-East side of the small lake and NOT the snowmobile opening as it is longer and easier to get lost. (Found out the hard way).Novice-Intermediate to Island LakeIntermediate-Advanced for access to the other lakesMakes a great 2-3 day trip or a relaxing week exploring all the islands and surrounding lakes.Trip Photoshttp://www.explorethebackcountry.com/trips/islandlake2011Subscribe for more and don't hesitate to ask for trip information, maps and whatever.

The Castle of White Otter LakeThis is my 22 minute documentary that tells the true story of Jimmy McOuat who constructed a castle singlehandedly out of red pine logs back in the early 1900's. The film contributed to the castle's eventual restoration which still stands on the shore of White Otter Lake in the wilderness of Northwestern Ontario. The Castle of White Otter Lake was produced, directed, shot and edited by me, Peter G. Elliott and the script was researched and written by Elinor Barr of Thunder Bay. Jimmy McOuat was played by Nick Kaminecky and the original music is by Cathy Elliott. A special thanks to Gordon Pinsent who narrated the film for me for a very small fee. An extended thanks to friends and family who helped me back in the early '80s.I shot this film on a $12,000 budget using my 16mm Bolex camera, an Ontario Arts Council grant and an editing room at The National Film Board. The film was shown on CBC's Canadian Reflections and on Global Television and various broadcasters in the British isles during the 1980's.

Air Force Day at RCAF Station Summerside - June 19638mm footage shot by my father, Harold Phillips, on June 15, 1963, which was Air Force Day at RCAF Station Summerside, Prince Edward Island, Canada.My father and mother both volunteered for service in the RCAF during World War II.  My father served with the 119th Bomber Reconnaissance Squadron as ground crew in Trenton ON, Yarmouth NS, Sydney NS, Gander NL, Edmonton AB, and Watson Lake, YT.  My mother worked in special operations in Torbay NL and Sydney NS, plotting convoy operations and submarine surveillance in the North Atlantic.There were many planes at this airshow, but of note are the Golden Hawks, the RCAF's aerobatic team from 1959-64 and the precursor to today's Canadian Forces 431 Air Demonstration Squadron (the Snowbirds).  You can read more about the Golden Hawks on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_HawksThe Golden Hawks had appeared in Charlottetown, PEI the year before, where an estimated 25,000 people jammed the roads leading to the air show (the population of Prince Edward Island in 1962 was just over 100,000).  Read about that day here: http://islandnewspapers.ca/islandora/object/guardian%3A19620820-003Some great footage of the Golden Hawks in action from the National Film Board of Canada: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVo9InROAXY

Nation Lakes Canoe RouteA seven day trip on the Nation Lakes Canoe Route north of Fort St. James which is NW of Prince George, BC, Canada.  Aug 22-29, 2009.  This trip is beautiful on big lakes.  It is similar to the Bowron Lakes in terms of length and difficulty.  But the solitude is much greater.  We saw only one canoe, day 2, of our trip and a power boat in the distance on day 5.  That, and a couple cabins on Chuchi, were the only signs of people that we saw.  We used Nation Lakes Canoeing Camp (www.nationlakes.com) for the canoe rental and shuttle (5 hrs on logging roads).  Trip report: http://northernwaters.shutterfly.comPhoto album: www.flickr.com/photos/94506934@N00/sets/72157622317029516

Oregon Dave interviews Phil Cotton of the Wabakimi ProjectOregon Dave Interviews Phil Cotton (aka Uncle Phil), founder of the Wabakimi Project, a unique grassroots volunteer initiative founded in 2004 to explore and document the historical and traditional canoe routes of Wabakimi Provincial Park in Central Ontario Canada. The end result is set of maps to help visitors plan and mount self-directed, self-guided canoe trips in the Wabakimi Area, a world class canoe destination.Phil and I discuss why this area is so important and what the Project is accomplishing. At the very end Uncle Phil explains and demonstrates the purpose of the conical birch bark device I found near a portage into a small lake, while participating in the Project’s first trip of 2015. Key Takeaways:  The Park was created in 1983 and expanded later to protect the remaining Woodland Caribou, a key indicator species. Access to the park itself is limited, making surrounding provincial parks and Crown lands important to map and protect as well.  The park and surrounding areas is much  larger than BWCA and Quetico combined, containing a world class canoe area that sees limited use. The mapping of canoe routes, portages & campsites is vitally important for the ultimate management plans to protect this resource for the future.  These plans are still in an early state of development.As the Wabakimi Project comes to a conclusion in a few more years, the new non-profit Friends of Wabakimi (www.wabakimi.org/fow/) will eventually assume responsibility for the volunteer conservancy efforts to rehabilitate and document canoe routes in the Wabakimi Area and participate in planning processes to advocate for the protection and preservation of the diverse natural, cultural and historical resources of the Wabakimi Area that includes adjacent parks and Crown lands.

Canoeing South Saskatchewan River - Saskatoon, SaskatchewanThe canoe is a Canadian wilderness icon.  It leaves no trace of its passage through the wilds, but it has left an indelible impression on the Canadian psyche.  Ancient aboriginals, early voyageurs and today's canoeists - all have been moved by the canoe - physically and spiritually.  With this in mind, it was only fitting that the GCAT crew spend an afternoon out on a river in a canoe.  We hooked up with outdoor enthusiast and owner of CanoeSki Discovery, Cliff Speer, for a paddle down the South Saskatchewan river.  Cliff has been canoeing these waters for over 30 years and is a firm believer that canoeing heightens the ecological senses.  He says it inspires a desire to care for the wild places that only a canoe can access.  At CanoeSki, they follow the environmental credo of respecting the earth in all their activities. This includes applying conservation principles to all aspects of the operation, practicing minimum impact camping, and contributing to local conservation efforts.During our paddle we not only enjoyed fantastic autumn weather, but we were fortunate to catch some of the annual migration of Canada geese, snow geese, and sandhill cranes.  One of the great things about canoeing is that without a motor you can blend in with the environment and get the opportunity to truly be at one with nature.  If you ever get to Saskatoon and want to give canoeing a try, call Cliff and he'll be happy to introduce you to one of Canada's favourite outdoor pastimes.  Follow the Great Canadian Adventure TourVisit our site:  http://www.greatcanadianadventuretour.com/Join us on Facebook and Twitter:http://www.facebook.com/GreatCanadianAdventureTourhttp://twitter.com/#!/CanadaAdventure

Temagami Family trip. Canoe crash at Sturgeon River. Happy ending. 2015We went to Temagami Provincial Park for the first time. Ahead of us was up to a week of paddling and camping in this part of Ontario.We started our tour happily at the top of Sturgeon River, and after a few meanders we saw a massive fallen tree blocking the river. The current was very strong, we couldn't manage to stop. We ended up broadside with the canoe sinking, luckily, to the right side of the river, paralel to the big tree trunk.Everything went under the tree, the canoe, all the gear, ourselves...(More) www . read . marcopolo . blogspot . com

Canoeing The North Saskatchewan River - Saskatchewan Crossing To Abraham LakeA day trip canoeing down the North Saskatchewan River.  Put-in near Saskatchewan Crossing, in Banff National Park, and took-out at Preacher's point, at the head of Abraham Lake.

French River Village Coponaning Ghost Town Saw Mill Alligator RuinsA trip to the French River area wouldn't be complete without a visit to the old Mill and Village Coponaning Town sites. The wreck symbols on the strip charts near buoy DC3  are supposedly from derelict "Alligator" tug boats left to die, all that remains are their boilers and pieces of tin. The area is now so overgrown it's difficult to piece together the mill site from a vintage low-res internet photo. Still lots of iron bits laying around, and portions of the original derelict steam engine. Anyone know the story about it?  Hard to imagine that a village of 1500 people at some point used to live here.

Waterway Tips #5 - Rice Lake Railway CribbingWhen crossing Rice Lake along the Trent Severn Waterway (TSW), one must be aware of an ancient railway cribbing that straddles the lake close to the entrance of the Otonabee River. This railway cribbing was installed in the mid 1800's but suffered extensive ice damage and was abandoned after only six years of service. There is a well marked spot to pass safely and is part of the main Small Craft Route that crosses in a east-west direction across the lake. Unfortunately, boaters who are unaware hit this obstruction every year - so keep an eye out for the markers and be aware of where you are! Rice Lake is one of the largest lakes along the TSW, second only to Lake Simcoe.Location of this video: 44.16467 -78.19322 (Rice Lake, Ontario)- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Be sure to check our site - http://Boogabooster.com - for information on purchasing our exclusive Trent Severn Waterway feature DVD that takes you from the beginning at 'Mile Zero' in Trenton, Ontario, and through to Port Severn at the north west end at Georgian Bay.

The Trent-Severn WaterwayThe Trent-Severn Waterway has many interesting and unique methods for moving boats from one body of water to another. This time-lapse video demonstrates just some of the locks that can be found along the route from Lake Ontario at the Bay of Quinte to Georgian Bay.Spending the summer visiting these locks, I was amazed by the engineering. Transfers are relatively quick, some as quick as 25 minutes for one sequence. This time-lapse video allows the visitor to see multiple transfers in just five minutes.I have enjoyed "The Summer of Time Lapse". It reminds me of my film days. I would shoot a roll of 36 and then wait for the C-41 processing before I could see the images. The anticipation is similar with time-lapse, I have to wait for all of the images to be processed into a movie before I can see all the details and movement that I could not see while photographing the sequence.Completed time-lapse sequences always surprise me, what is captured in the detail. Clouds would appear still during the shoot only to reveal their formation and movement in a time-lapse. Much like a macro image reveals microscopic detail, time-lapse photography reveals details of time and movement.I have looked at many time-lapse movies by other Photographers. Some convey a serene or calm approach. Others get the “Holy Grail” day to night transition spot on. I love the added motion that moving the camera in some way brings. This movie only utilises the Ken Burns effect provided in iMovie.  I used a Nikon D7100 DSLR and the Triggertrap Mobile intervalometer on my iPad to trigger the camera. Most of the sequences were captured with intervals between 1 and 5 seconds. As the summer progressed, so did the capture settings. I went from Jpeg to Raw adding ND filters trying for the elusive 1/40, f3.5, and ISO 100.I have invested in LRTimelapse and Adobe Lightroom for the digital darkroom. All sequences were rendered at 24 frames per second. The final movie was edited in iMovie.Please let me know what you think in the comments below.

Waterway Tips #7 - Navigation Markers Change At KirkfieldWhen traveling along the Trent Severn Waterway, keep in mind that Kirkfield is the apex of the system. From this highest point on the waterway, it's downstream both ways. That means that the navigation buoys and day marker colours switch, in keeping with the 'Red Right Return' navigation rule. The Trent Severn Waterway is located in Ontario, Canada. It's 240 mile/386 km long series of lakes, rivers and canals connect Lake Ontario at Trenton with Georgian Bay/Lake Huron at Port Severn and forms an integral part of America's Great Loop.Location of this video: 44.58983 -78.99106- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Be sure to check our site - http://Boogabooster.com - for information on purchasing our exclusive Trent Severn Waterway feature DVD that takes you from the beginning at 'Mile Zero' in Trenton, Ontario, and through to Port Severn at the north west end at Georgian Bay.

Blue Whale Bottlenose Dolphin fighting to survive. Close-up experience.Audio: Final Cloud by Kevin McLeod -  http://bit.ly/NNAtTAThis is not your National Geographic  photo essay of Bottlenose Dolphins and Blue Whales, but it definitely  shows our excitement. A family of Florida Gulf Bottlenose Dolphins playfully followed our boat wake on one trip. The St. Lawrence in Quebec gave us the Blue Whales. These ocean creatures are awesome and human friendly, although I sure, if they wanted to, could toss you around like a rubber ducky play toy. The Blue Whales literally surfaced within 15 feet from our rubber Zodiak - thrilling and exciting. Blue Whales can grow to 100 feet (30 meters) long and weight around 200 tons. An adult Blue Whale can consume as much  as 4 tons of krill per day. The shocking part is that there's less than 5,000 Blue Whales left on our planet -- an endangered species.  They are fighting to survive. Bottlenose Dolphins are the other extreme of the whale family, and even though they are not considered endangered, only 1 million of them left. To put that in perspective there are 7 billion of us humans.  The Bottlenose Dolphin grows to roughly 12 feet long and weighs about 1,400 pounds. Enjoy and protect them. Take care of our oceans. Spread the word. We only have one chance.

Hundreds of Dolphins chasing The Cruise Ship Disney WonderAn amazing thing happened on the cruise ship Disney Wonder, a sunset stroll on the walking deck caused a chance encounter with a very large pod of dolphins.  There were dolphins everywhere!  The encounter lasted a little over a minute as the dolphins tired and could not maintain the 15 knot pace of The Disney Wonder cruising the Inside Passage of British Columbia on the way back from an Alaska Cruise enroute to Vancouver. The exact location was Robson Bight.

Board Recovery & Self RescueA lengthy story to this vid... wind was ramping up as I pumped kites, I went through it all; 14/10 & 7m Rises. The 14 had a weak valve that finally gave way and the 10 had too many pin holes in the LE so next I rigged the 7m. During play time Chris tells me he lost his board and that it's most likely across the bay. So... @ 3:12 is when that adventure starts. I end up finding it after having a fabulous lengthy downwinder, try to bring it back but the wind totally dies, and for good. I end up self rescuing with the 7m in tow but at least we got his board back. Damn good times and OR saves LF's ass. Heading home the setting sun was poking through the trees, saw a nasty collision then entered the twin sails marking your arrival to Cold Lake.

Newfoundland Scenery - Beautiful BonavistaSeveral years ago I spent a beautiful July 1st. weekend tenting, hiking and boating in the Bonavista area.. including Elliston, King's Cove, Maberley, Knight's Cove, Cape Bonavista, Amherst Cove, Newman's Cove, Spillars Cove, Catalina, Port Union, Port Rexton.  Took lots of great photographs and decided to do this video to commemorate that wonderful trip.   I chose Kim Stockwood's hauntingly beautiful song, "How Many Miles To Home", as the background music.  She now lives in Ontario, but is from Bonavista.﻿

Tug Gulf Regent. Squamish River Offload.The clip opens at a rather dismal looking place in Howe sound. We were there to pick up one piece off equipment for Squamish. We offload at Squamish, the Squamish Chief can be seen in the background. clip ends leaving the river. The bulkhead were we offloaded was not suited to the cutaway ramp on the barge, but with a little more tide all went well. Most times we never new what the offload site was like till we got to there.
BC Ferries Daring Rescue of Man OverboardOriginal Footage.  People on the Powell River to Comox ferry said they saw the man jump from the upper deck.  The crew was quickly in the water to attempt a rescue but the motor of the zodial died.  They then had to put a second zodiak into the water to get to the man.  Luckily there was an ambulance crew on the ferry that tended to the man when he was brought back to the ferry.Some said that he was a homeless man that jumped but the man himself said he fell (likely to avoid charges).  Police are investigating.

Tug Gulf Regent. Finn bay and Spiller Inlet central coast bc.This  video starts loading at Finn Bay at mouth of the mouth of Rivers inlet, and continues to the upper reaches of Spiller Inlet were we load more logs, Most of our trips were put together this way. We filled in the gaps that the big boys couldn't pick up.... cost wise. Our loads usually consisted of several stops, so the barge was moved to differant sites till we got a full load south bound. Our missed load was picked up next time around. Check out Stryker Island video. My channel has been up for one year now and i appreciate the support from my subscibers. Cheers, Larry   ps. The videos are a little long for youtube but i'm trying to tell a story... sort of ...or explain a little of what's happening or how it worked.

Frozen, the Sea is frozen, but wait, what do I see out there, Awesome, amazing and incredibleLooking to see what is going on across the road, and then getting a closer look at the great river that flows beyond the iceThis Year has been colder than most and there has not been a big thaw or a storm capable of breaking-up the ice that has built-up with many successive extreme cold days/weeks. Even the tides have not broken-up the ice this Year, the flowing waters, mixed with ice are at the edge of where the eye can see. But with the use of deep zoom, I was able to capture the flow as it speeds along, far from shore, on the mighty St-Lawrence estuary (where the river becomes the gulf), here in Sainte-Anne-Des-Monts Quebec, on the Northern shore of the Gaspe peninsula.merci de votre visionnement,prenez un petit moment afin de visiter https://www.youtube.com/user/danbythesea Je vous invite a venir visitez mon site: http://www.danbythesea.com/francais.htmlthank you for watching, take a moment to visit my YouTube pagehttps://www.youtube.com/user/danbytheseaI invite you to visit my site:http://www.danbythesea.com/english.html
