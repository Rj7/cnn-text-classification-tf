british columbia salmon extinction? a reality check.     anti-salmon farming critics have repeated claims of wild salmon extinction in british columbia. is this true? are salmon going extinct?    not at all. not even close. in fact, fraser river sockeye (near vancouver) just returned in high numbers not seen in 100 years.    first the activists said salmon farms were driving the pink salmon to extinction. but since these erroneous claims were made, pink salmon have returned to bc rivers in record high numbers.    to divert attention away from record pink salmon returns, activists then said that the fraser river sockeye were at risk - again because of bc salmon farms. but again, the 2010 return of sockeye salmon was the highest witnessed since 1913.     activists such as alexandra morton and john volpe have repeated these extinction claims - claims that were designed to tarnish the reputation of bc farm-raised salmon and ultimately threaten the livelihood of thousands of hard working british columbians.     this video was produced to capture these claims and provide the public with the truth. salmon farming in bc farm-raised salmon salmon extinction alexandra morton wild salmon alaska salmon farming hatchery salmon fraser river sockeye bc salmon farming adams river sockeye pink salmon broughton archipelago william shatner bill shatner 100 year record slammin salmon slamon cohen commission bruce cohen fraser river sockeye inquiry 2010 salmon returns best fishing sockeye salmon

fishing kootenay lake in british columbia pemberton fish finder had never fished kootenay lake in british columbia prior to this video.  it took us a few hours to locate the fish and to find out what to use.  once we got it figured out it was non stop action.  there are a lot of huge gerrard rainbow trout in kootenay lake and they are well protected by the use of barbless hooks.  i lost track of how many trophy fish we lost due to barbless hooks, around 35 and that is no exaggeration.  the house boat is a great way to get to know this lake because it is over 100kms long.  we made camp on the beach and carried on our way the next day.  this fishing trip was one of the most enjoyable adventures i have ever been on.  this boat was 42' long.  for more fishing reports and to hire a guide visit our website  enjoy the video! kootenay lake fishing videos gerrard rainbow trout bc fishing canada fishing lyman plugs army truck hoochie british columbia canada fishing fishing in bc bc fishing reports bc fishing trips bc fishing guides bc fishing blogs

coho salmon and chum salmon fly fishing in squamish bc canada coho salmon and chum salmon fly fishing in squamish bc canada.  right now the chum salmon and coho salmon fishing in squamish is fantastic!  in the past couple of days the squamish river, cheakamus river and the mamquam river have been receiving waves of beautiful chrome chum and coho salmon.  unlike the pink salmon fishery, the banks are not lined elbow to elbow with eager fishermen.  the weather is brisk in the morning and warms to the mid teens, which is perfect salmon fishing temperatures.  the water is very cold so make sure you put on your long underwear under your waders.  the chum salmon season is fairly short and peaks by mid november, while the coho salmon will be in the rivers till late december.  coho salmon and chum salmon fly fishing patterns are similar in design and are fished both with a swinging motion.  typically there are more chum salmon in the rivers surrounding squamish.  periodically, you will be pleasantly surprised when you hook up on a coho salmon using the same flies used for chum salmon fly fishing.  although coho salmon are not nearly as large, coho salmon can reach a staggering 20 lbs in the rivers surrounding squamish.  below is a picture of a couple fly fishing patterns that have been working for both coho and chum salmon in the squamish river. we have found in the past couple of days that a sleek bodied fly with either orange or green highlights have been working best.  we have been using a type 3 sink tip fly line, tipped with a leader 6' - 8' in length with a breaking strength of 15 lbs on an 8 weight fly rod.  some people might suggest the use of a leader strength of 20 lbs, this being said 20 lbs leaders will have the capability of breaking an 8 weight fly rod if you are not careful when the salmon are at your feet.  simply swinging one of these fly patterns until your line straitens down stream, then a long slow retrieve will produce both chum salmon and coho salmon.  chum salmon takes are typically subtle, while coho salmon bites are typically earth shattering.  you will know what i am talking about when it happens.  once hooked both salmon put on an aerial display and make large reel screaming runs.   below are a few pictures of chum salmon caught on the squamish river october 26th, 2015 while fly fishing with the pemberton fish finder.  we have also included a short salmon fishing video of our day of the squamish river.  right now is the time to book your chum salmon and coho salmon fly fishing trip of a lifetime with the pemberton fish finder.  call today toll free 1(877)905-8121 don't miss out on this spectacular fly fishing experience.  limited space available!  visit our website for more information about salmon fly fishing tours in squamish, bc and rates  .  if you are staying in whistler, squamish or pemberton british columbia we will pick you up from your accommodations, provide you with all of the fishing equipment and on full days a tasty lunch is also provided.  all you have to bring is a valid bc freshwater fishing license, suitable clothing for the weather and a camera to gather photographs of your fly fishing tour of a lifetime.  we look forward to fly fishing with you,  pemberton fish finder. fly fishing chum salmon coho salmon fly fishing tours fly fishing bc fly fishing squamish chum salmon fly patterns coho salmon fly fishing patterns chum salmon fishing tours in bc coho salmon and chum salmon fly fishing in squamish bc canada fishing chum salmon in canada fly fishing chum salmon in canada chum salmon fly fishing in bc chum salmon fly fishing trips in british columbia fly fishing squamish fly fishing whistler pemberton fish finder

wtf? mountsberg reservoir conservation area, halton, ontario 1:56 caught a pike :)  i went to checkout this place for shore fishing opportunities and it's very limited. there's a long shoreline with train tracks but it's illegal to walk along there and also dangerous. you can get fined by the park ranger. i only explored half the lake and i found only 6 spots you can fish from shore. i confirmed that there are bass and pike in here. there's a small lookout dock where i almost caught a bass by twitching the senko underneath the dock. the family that was fishing there caught a lot of bluegills and cat fish.  i do not recommend fishing here but it's a great place to bring family as there are kid-friendly activities there such as a mini farm and nice playgrounds. where to fish in gta gta fishing fishing outside toronto fishing in gta fishing in toronto urban fishing urban shore fishing toronto urban fishing ratnak t.u.f.a toronto urban fishing ambassadors gopro fishing gopro black edition bass fishing toronto ontario fishing lake ontario fishing shore fishing gta shore fishing mountsberg conservation area (location) mountsberg fishing ontario mountsberg reservoir mountsberg fishing mountsberg conservation halton

leduc reservoir rainbow trout fishing challenge i never fished leduc reservoir before but always knew they stocked it every spring with rainbow trout.  over the years i have heard that some may overwinter and get to large sizes.  i also read that this lake is notorious for sending anglers home with the skunk rather than a nice fat rainbow trout.  so i made it my personal challenge to go there and catch some of those fat fish.  i was determined not to take the skunk home with me.  since the reservoir is only 10 minutes from my in-laws farm it makes a quick outing.  so i headed out early one frosty morning and launch my boat.  i trolled and casted every lure known to man all over that piece of water for no bites.  so around 2 pm i landed right where i launched and started to fish.  turns out that is where all the hungry fish were and i hooked up on seven but only got one on shore.  took him home for dinner and called it a day.  hope these tips can also help you catch some of those fish on the reservoir. fishing (tv genre) rainbow trout (organism classification) challenge leduc reservoir alberta canada trolling dingy boat rapala mepps berkley power nymph water boatman how to catch tips tricks information investigation first time need help tutorial edmonton pothole lake best mini jig shore fishing the fishing doctor adventures jigging (sports equipment)

salt water fishing tours - glacier bay country inn - gustavus alaska glacier bay and icy strait possess all the best attributes of saltwater big-game fishing, without any of the shortcomings.  consider the facts as to why our sport fisheries are second to none.  because we primarily fish inside waters, travel time to blue-ribbon fishing grounds takes less than 40 minutes. because there are no ocean swells where we fish, seasickness is rare.  the waters we fish are also protected from severe storms, which allow fishing when other areas are blown out.  each summer, humpback whales migrate to our waters from as far away as hawaii to feed and fatten up on an abundance of bait fish and herring. the abundance of feed also attracts bottom fish, like alaska halibut.  we catch huge halibut here as opposed to what they catch in other parts of alaska. we have often said the next world record would come from here and this summer what would have been a world record had it been handled correctly was caught here. a 482 lb monster.  veteran saltwater anglers fish with us each year because of the sheer number and variety of sport fish we have.  fishing at this alaska fishing lodge is also ideal for spouses or non-anglers who want to indulge in alaska sport fishing for the first time. were also the destination of choice for the angler or non-angler who wants to take home a sampling of fresh alaska seafood to share with family and friends. halibut glacier bay national park and preserve (protected site) salt water fishing fishing charter gustavus (city/town/village) alaska (us state)

everyday is a heli fishing kind of day in british columbia fish stories are known for stretching the truth.  small fish get bigger, big fish get bigger, and the stories get more epic with each retelling.  sometimes there's no need for exaggeration, sometimes there's a helicopter.  the difference between a good day and a great day fishing is a scenic flight through the coastal mountains of british columbia.  let's not forget about the trout fishing, these fish rarely see hooks.  this makes them very eager to bite almost anything you tie on the end of your fishing line.  first time fly fishers feel like a pro, simply because you can do no wrong.  get your friends and family members hooked on fishing on one of the many high paced, remote alpine lakes surrounding whistler, british columbia.  there is nothing quite like having a lake to yourself for the day that is absolutely steaming with fish.   we typically wrap up the heli fishing season by the end of october or as snow starts to fly in the alpine.  as the days grow shorter, trout really start to feed frantically in anticipation for the winter months.  i've had trout take a fly dangling over the side of my float tube while i searched for another pattern that was less worn.  the only reason you will typically change a fly is because it has been worn out by repeated abuse.   there is no need for a substantial fly selection, simply bring a few locator flies such as black spratleys,  pumpkin heads and wooly buggers in a variety of colors.  dry fly fishing can almost seem like work just keeping your fly riding high.  at almost the second your fly hits the water it will boil with trout activity.  we have found that the larger of trout caught are caught with wet flies. our small flotation devises are called float tubes.  float tubes are very comfortable and pack away nice and compact which is important being there is limited space in a helicopter.  these float tubes gain you access to an entire alpine lake, no fish is safe.  it is difficult to take in the endless scenery in every direction and the thousand smells of fresh alpine air between bites.  at the end of the day or during your lunch, sit back and enjoy a small campfire.  going home with the smell of success on your hands and the light aroma of campfire smoke on your clothing is the proof of a great day. to book a memorable heli fishing trip in british columbia call our booking agent "melissa" toll free (877)905-8121 or email info@pembertonfishfinder.com .  you can also visit our heli fishing page on our website for more information about heli fishing in british columbia, canada.  we also offer multiple day trips, river fly fishing, tolling tours and ice fishing tours to name a few.  view other fishing trips we offer here  we look forward to heli fishing with you in british columbia, pemberton fish finder.  heli fishing helicopter fishing helicopter fishing british columbia heli fishing british columbia bc fishing trips lots of fish best fishing in bc best fishing in british columbia helicopter scenic flights in bc pemberton fish finder fishing in whistler fly fishing in whistler fishing trips in whistler fishing guides in whistler bc fishing guides bc freshwater fishing trips fishing videos bc fishing videos

how to catch cold lake walleye fishing alberta cold lake is one of the few lakes in the province where you can still keep walleye without a tag.  this is not due to the abundance of walleye though, but rather due to fisheries not managing this as a walleye fishery.  they don't seem to care what happens to the population sadly.  so for now you can keep some but they sure are elusive and after fishing a few days for them i finally managed to catch three.  there are much better walleye lakes in the province and if you are just after walleye you probably could spend your time better somewhere else.  consider trying near by moose lake or marie lake that are loaded with walleye and where you can also keep one for the dinner table.  if you do go to cold lake you will have a lot more fun fishing for the abundant pike and lake trout that come in very large sizes at this lake.  hope you enjoy the video. walleye (organism classification) cold lake (lake) lake (geographical feature category) fishing how to tips tricks hints help where tutorial tip alberta canada swimbait big hammer northland tackle fishing alberta open water spring june catching big huge massive fat walleye fishing cold lake (city/town/village)

walleye fishing red lake mn 12-20-2015 walleye fishing on the huge red lake in northern minnesota is a unique experience. it's divided into an upper and lower portion, and only about half of the upper portion is accessible to most anglers. the other two thirds is part of a reservation. it gets a large amount of fishing pressure, and 30+ fish days are possible. the daily possession limit is 3 walleyes, and only one fish may be over 17".   an abnormally mild winter meant that the ice was only between 5-9" thick in most spots. some access points allowed atvs, while others allowed only foot traffic; however, that's likely to change shortly with a string of colder weather. ice fishing walleye walleye fishing red lake upper red lake red lake walleyes red lake crappies walleye ice fishing ice fishing walleyes minnesota fishing minnesota buckshot rattle spoon lindy tip up

fishing with rod: 2007 cultus lake pikeminnow derby the 2007 cultus lake pikeminnow derby took place on saturday june 16th, 2007. this annual derby is part of the all about fishing family event, which is organized by the fraser valley salmon society.    the goal of the derby is to generate sportfishing interest among the younger generations, as well as assisting fisheries and oceans canada on their cultus lake sockeye salmon recovery program. northern pikeminnow is a predatory species that prey on juvenile salmon. due to a lack of predators, the population of northern pikeminnow in cultus lake has grown to the size that causes a lower return of cultus lake sockeye salmon. fisheries and oceans canada hopes to enhance the sockeye population by reducing the northern pikeminnow population.    this event is also part of the province-wide family fishing weekend, which always takes place during the father's day weekend.    many thanks to dean werk and greg larson of great river fishing adventures for taking us our on their boats.    if you wish to have your community event covered, please email me at info@fishingwithrod.com    for more information on northern pikeminnow, please visit:      for more information on the cultus lake sockeye salmon recovery program, please visit:      for more information on the fraser valley salmon society, please visit:      to see the derby report and results, please visit:      for more videos such as this, please visit  and subscribe at     camera and editing: rodney hsu  music: chris macleod  production: fishing with rod production northern pikeminnow pikeminnow fishing pike minnow fishing cultus lake fishing chilliwack fishing fraser valley fishing fishing derby pikeminnow derby pike minnow derby bc fishing fish bc british columbia fishing fishing with rod fishingwithrod.com squawfish fishing northern squawfish

salmon troll fishing: discover the story of how salmon are harvested watch how fish harvesters use hooks and lines, trailed behind their vessels at low speed, to catch salmon. the hooks are attached to lures that imitate the salmon's food, such as herring and squid. salmon are individually hooked and the lines are pulled in with a hydraulic winch and a series of poles, pulleys, weights and floats. however, fish harvesters haul in each salmon by hand for the last 20 to 60 feet (6 to 18 metres)a struggle in which the skill and agility of the harvester is paramount. troll vessels range in size from 30 to 55 feet and have a crew of two to four. they store their fish on ice or freeze it at sea. trollers primarily target king chinook and silver coho salmon, but can also catch pink, keta chum and sockeye salmon.  for more info, visit the following troll salmon pages:  bc west coast of vancouver island:  bc north coast / haida gwaii:  bc inside passage:   credits: producers: goodforks editing: blue chip productions  funding support for this video provided, in part, by the bc government's buy local program; delivered by the investment agriculture foundation of bc with funding from the bc ministry of agriculture. thisfish ecotrust canada fishery seafood sustainable seafood commercial fishing fishing canada (country) british columbia (canadian province) salmon (ingredient) sockeye salmon (organism classification) chum salmon (organism classification) keta salmon chinook salmon (organism classification) coho salmon (organism classification) king salmon pink salmon (organism classification) trolling troll fishing trollers

salmon gillnet fishing: discover the story of how salmon are harvested fish harvesters use curtains of netting suspended by a system of floats and weights to catch salmon. the fine netting is almost invisible so salmon unwittingly swim into the mesh. as they try to back out, their gill covers get snagged and the fish becomes entangled in the net.  fish harvesters set their rectangular nets from either the stern or bow of their vessels. altering the mesh size, the way in which nets are suspended in the water and the amount of time they soak allows fish harvesters to selectively target certain species or sizes. because of their effectiveness at catching salmon, gill-net fishery openings tend to be relatively short, allowing fish harvesters only hours or a few days to net their catch.  for more info, visit these gillnet fisheries pages:  bc north coast:  bc vancouver island:  bc fraser river:  bc barkley sound:   credits: producers: goodforks editing: blue chip productions videography: kobb media  funding support for this video provided, in part, by the bc government's buy local program; delivered by the investment agriculture foundation of bc with funding from the bc ministry of agriculture.  special thanks to the canadian council of professional fish harvesters for providing video and photographs for the production of the video, and to captain victor thibault and his crew. thisfish ecotrust canada fishery seafood sustainable seafood commercial fishing fishing canada (country) british columbia (canadian province) salmon (ingredient) sockeye salmon (organism classification) chum salmon (organism classification) keta salmon gillnet

best walleye fishing in alberta lesser slave lake lesser slave lake in alberta is known for great walleye fishing and this was my first experience on the lake during the hard water season.  supposedly 90 % of the fish spawn in the river running into the west side of the lake.  since we were fishing the first week of march and spring was coming it seemed like the west side of the lake would be an obvious choice to try.  we drove onto the lake and noticed a line of ice huts.  we picke a location and drilled some holes and noted these shacks were not on any structure.  so we drilled towards shore until we found to drop off from 30 feet of water up to 10 feet.  as soon as we got onto the drop we started to nail the walleye.  they were very concentrated in this location and the action was steady for the first few hours.  it tapered off later during the day but we continued to catch walleye, pike and tulibee.  in the afternoon we tried our deeper holes near the ice hut depth and ended up catching a couple nice perch and more walley.  what a great day for our first time ice fishing the lake. lesser slave lake (lake) walleye (organism classification) fishing (tv genre) alberta (canadian province) walleye fishing canada best worlds best amazing huge monster ice fishing the fishing doctor advetnures slave lake march spring winter cold spring break eskimo tent slender spoon cicada how to tips tricks information help need tutorial tulibee northern pike pickerel

how to ice fish for perch - ice fishing jigging tips and tricks we are out here with antonio, the boatless angler, and we're out here using some stingnose jigging spoons and we're ice fishing for perch.we're getting a larger mixed bag of sizes when compared to last week.   if you'd like to get your own stingnose, you can get them here:   we have a strategic spot that we're fishing at today. we'refishing specifically on top of the 'white ice' - the area of the ice which is either covered in snow, or otherwise solidwhite andopaque.  this snow-covered ice helps give some cover to the fish down below, and helps shield us from the fish. as the water we're fishing today is very clear.  if we were sitting on the clear ice, the fish might be able to see us, and be startled by our movements. if you have the chance to fish a snow-covered area, that will help your day out on the ice.  right now my line is about 6 to 8 inches off of the bottom and that's where the fish are currently holding.when you jig for perch, panfish, or even walleye, there are many different jigging techniques which you can use.  i'm mainly using a slowerlift and drop technique to start. sometimes jiggling the line a bit, or giving a very slow lift. you can also use a more aggressive snap, which makes the lure look like a minnow darting away. vary your technique to feel out which is working for the fish. sometimes subtle works, where sometimes big aggressive motions work.  the key with any technique is to always provide a pause - as the pause or the downward motion of the lure tends to be when the fish will strike.   click here to subscribe for more fishing videos:   follow our ongoing fishing adventures instagram:  facebook:  twitter:  web:   as always until next time, good luck and good fishin'! thundermist thundermist lures thundermist lure company thundermist fishing tips fishing tips fishing fish water angler angling (sport) fisherman fishermen ice fishing ice winter ontario canada survival suit help how to perch yellow perch techniques sports sport jigging spoon jigging jig stingnose sting nose february snow advice tips tip tricks trick

huge top water striper triple-header! crazy top water action! we find ourselves back in the saltwater, this time using top water plugs targeting striper and bluefish.  for attached your top water plug to your line, you can tie it direct, though i suggest using a simple duo-lock snap - not a snap swivel.  to fish these top waters lure, especially in top water, i like to run them a little more aggressively. when the lure hits the water i reel in about 3 to 4 cranks really fast, then pause, then 3 to 4 cranks really fast again. as you're reeling, the lure is making all these bubbles and splashes on the water, and with the pause it gives the perfect moment for stripers or blues to hammer it!  when you're using top water baits, it's very important to pause just for a second or two before setting the hook. i can't tell you how many times i've pulled the lure right from the fishes mouth pulling right away. give the fish a moment to take the lure underwater.  i like the top water plugs that have the open rounded mouth to create that all that splash and sound, moreso than the 'walk the dog' style of top water baits which slide or zig-zag over the top of the water.  click here to subscribe for more fishing videos:   follow our ongoing fishing adventures instagram:  facebook:  twitter:  web:   as always until next time, good luck and good fishin'! thundermist thundermist lures thundermist lure company thundermist fishing tips fishing tips fishing fish water angler angling (sport) fisherman fishermen saltwater striper top water top water plug crankbait crank bait thundermistlures catch striped bass (organism classification) striper fishing advice crank artificial bait bait how to fish bluefish huge striper tripple header triple header cape cod mass ocean how to catch striper striped bass

trolling tips for big winter lake trout in lake ontario today we're out there at the mouth of lake ontario, doing something i normally wouldn't do until the spring: trolling for lake trout. this time i'm trolling right at the top of winter using the new american smelt crankbaits.   click here to subscribe for more fishing videos:   normally we would not be able to troll for lake trout in the winter, though the warmer weather we've been having made for the perfect opportunity.  these american smelts are going to drive down to the perfect depth of about 16 to 20 feet deep. if you'd got thinner diameter fishing line, the american smelt crankbait will dive about 20 feet, though if you have thicker diameter fishing line, it'll dive down to about 16 feet. it's surprising, but fishing line does make a difference.  if you want to get your own american smelt crankbaits, you can get them here:   today i'm trolling with a slow action rod. the action of a fishing rod describes the how much of the whole rod will bend when pressure, or in the case of reeling in a big lake trout, the pulling on the tip of the rob.  a slow action rod has a long bend, almost all the way down to the handle.  slow action rods are perfect for trolling because it takes up a lot of the line when you go to set the hook, and helps give that fish an extra chance to get into that bait. similar to how braided fishing line has less give than fluorocarbon. compared to a fast action rod would have a much faster hook set. which would be preferred in many other fishing situations.  today we're going to cover a lot of ground, and as hoped, we got ourselves into our fair share of big winter lake trout!   follow our ongoing fishing adventures instagram:  facebook:  twitter:  web:   as always until next time, good luck and good fishin'! thundermist thundermist lures thundermist lure company thundermist fishing tips fishing tips fishing fish water angler angling (sport) fisherman fishermen freshwater fresh water lake trout lake ontario ontario lake trout trolling troll drift december winter cold water cold boat outboard motor honda survival suit fishing rod crankbait crank bait baits artificial bait artificial baits artificial 20 feet deep big help advice tips tricks action

how to secure your hook/jig on your rod for travel and storage | thundermist quick fishing tip hello folks, this week we'd like to share a quick fishing tip on how to store your jig/hook on your rod while travelling, or storing your set up.  often i've seen people place their hooks inside the ceramic eye of their fishing rod. although this might seem fine, in essence it can create a serious problem. over time the hook will wear away at the smoothness of the eye. a damaged eye on your rod will cause your line to fray or even cut it straight off.  hopefully this simple tip helps prevent any cut-off down the road.  as always god luck and good fishin'! ivo thundermist thundermist lures thundermist lure company thundermist fishing tips fishing tips fishing fish water angler fisherman fishermen fishing rod (sports equipment) jigging (sports equipment) hooks hook storage travel safe preservation fishing rod eye eye hook ceramic eye jig spoon quick tip advice tip tips quick

jigging tips for walleye on the rocks it's a great, but cold day out here on the water. we're rigged up with flexi-jigs and fishing along the rocky bottom for walleye!  what we're going to be doing today, is running a chartreuse flexi jig baited up an artificial minnow-type bait. since there is no weed in this area, we're casting out as far as we can, and bouncing the jigs in towards the boat.  for fishing line, we're using 10lb test braided line off of a 10lb test fluorocarbon leader, on a medium heavy rod. a great combination for jigging!  the thinner braided line helps me get nice long casts in, and the medium heavy rod really helps with those hooksets.  for jigging technique, we're not jigging hard, but rather giving it a slow lift up, and a slow lift back down. this slower jigging technique i find to be more effective in the colder spring water, specifically targeting the pre-spawn bite.  click here to subscribe for more fishing videos:   follow our ongoing fishing adventures instagram:  facebook:  twitter:  web:   as always until next time, good luck and good fishin'! thundermist thundermist lures thundermist lure company thundermist fishing tips fishing tips fishing fish water angler angling (sport) fisherman fishermen freshwater walleye instagram thundermistlures jigging jigging for walleye flexi-jig artificial bait minnow bait artificial minnow spring pre spawn walleye spring bite advice fishing technique help how to how-to chartreuse jig drifting boat how to catch walleye walleye catching spring walleye

easy carp fishing tips - simple bite detection tips and huge carp catching action hello folks, on today's episode we're going to be fishing for carp. we'll be using a different set up to help with easier bite detection.  sometime when a carp bites, you'll really know it. although sometimes carp will have a slow bite that can be difficult to spot. this setup works for those big, obvious bites, as well as the slow not-obvious bites.  for this setup we're using a medium sized t-turn for the extra strength as it's rated up to 50 lbs. from the t-turn we go 4 inches down to the sinker, and a much longer line out to a simple hook. the bobber however, is not to keep our line suspending, as we definitely want that longer line with the hook to rest right on the bottom.  the trick is to pull your bobber high enough on your line so the sinker does not pull the bobber below the surface of the water. you'll want the bobber far enough just enough do that it can lay flat on the top of the water.   as soon as that bobber goes down... it's time to set the hook!   follow our ongoing fishing adventures instagram:  facebook:  twitter:  web:   as always until next time, good luck and good fishin'! thundermist thundermist lures thundermist lure company thundermist fishing tips fishing tips fishing fish water angler angling (sport) fisherman fishermen carp (organism classification) freshwater fresh water boat aluminium boat lake simple carp bottom feeders corn natural bait bobber rocket bobber help advice tricks tips easy quick tutorial catch release sinker bite detection chum surface t-turn hook

amazing kalamalka kokanee spawning this video is all thanks to my dad who went down to coldstream to check out the spawning kokanee salmon in the creek.  turns out they have already started to come into the streams in good numbers and there are some big fish showing up.  some monsters for the average kokanee fisherman.  these things look more like their ocean swimming cousins the sockeye salmon rather than the land locked version.  these guys don't have far to swim to spawn though and we're hoping they have an amazing year to continue the cycle of life and keep kokanee in beautiful kalamalka lake for years to come.  check out the great shots of these amazing little fish as they prepare to spawn.  thanks for watching. kalamalka lake (lake) spawn tourist destination british columbia fishing kokanee spawning kokanee salmon salmon sockeye salmon sockeye amazing action fish amazing interesting cool coldstream vernon bc bcfishn fishing with rod humpback aggressive iphone movie the fishing doctors adventures canada kokanee beer tourism (interest) conservation spectacular wonderful beautiful awesome huge monster big fat incredible best 2014 spawning run

alberta fisheries management walleye test net pull results so i didn't think it would be a big deal to make a short documentary of the alberta fisheries management test netting in alberta.  turns out that i was wrong.  they did not want us to video the nets being pulled.  they stated pictures were fine, but no video.  it is too bad because i thought the biologist shared a lot of good information with us. i tried to repeat what he said in this video.  talking with them really changed my view a lot regarding the whole activity of test netting.  they were nice, both boats called us right on over so that they could tell us what they were doing.  sorry i had to blur most of the video to protect their identity.  i still think you get good picture of what is going on.  i know this testing seems to be a controversial subject, but i think if they were more open to the public and wouldn't try to be so secretive maybe they would be more accepted.  or are they doing something wrong?  tell me what you think. fisheries management walleye (organism classification) fishing canada alberta sustainable resources test net test netting northern pike yellow perch jumbo perch biologist marine biologist fisheries biologist biology controversy controversial undercover detective documentary the fishing doctors adventures political canon rebel t2i

how to catch pigeon lake walleye and fill tags spring fishing walleye in the first week of june can sometimes be a little tricky.  with water temperatures still low the walleye are not always as active as you would expect by mid june.  the fish are still moving from their spawning areas back to prime feeding areas.  needless to say a little hide and seek is sometimes needed to begin your walleye fishing day.  first try near prime spawning locations and fish shallower than you usually would later in the summer.  walleye can be found in a few feet of water at this time of year around rocky shorelines, creeks or river mouths.  if you don't find activity in those locations you should head to structure where you usually find them in mid june.  some fish will have already taken up residence off main lake points, mid lake humps, flats and so on.  but this some of year fish will really be keying in on fish holding structure since there isn't really weed growth yet to protect the bait fish from predation.  so where ever you find rocky cover for bait fish  you will probably find the walleye.  go for a slower presentation and sometimes tipping with a piece of minnow will work well.  if using lures i prefer mid size cicada's by reef runner fished slow along the bottom or small swimbaits.  the fish will be eating small forage fish at this time of year and many times are often surviving on fresh water shrimp and may fly larva as i found in some stomach contents this spring.  so small presentations will often trigger more strikes.  don't forget to give this a try next time you are out this spring. pigeon lake (body of water) walleye (organism classification) fishing michigan fish tags alberta canada how to spring june cicada reef runner big hammer swimbait mid lake hump structure information tips funny hilarious goof the fishing doctors adventures adventure pickerel northern pike jigging edmonton tricks hint help where to fish

high pressure cold front ice fishing - the struggle is real this last year my borther came up from montana while we were in alberta.   we had hopes of great ice fishing, but mother nature had different plans.  the somewhat warm weather the week prior turned to frigid cold with daytime temps from -25 to -30 degrees c.  while i often have good luck in cold temps, this time combined with the high pressure system and sliver moon phase just seemed to put the fish into hiding.  this didn't stop us from working as hard as we could to put fish on the ice.  with several missed fish and one decent pike lost we were somewhat disappointed.  then the sun started to set and a few small walleye came in to save the day.  the struggle is real but a day on the ice is better than any day at work. high pressure cold front moon phase fishing ice fishing how to tips information fishing calendar biting amazing great walleye tough hard poor education find howto searching alberta pinehurst lake canada northern pike marcum rapala in depther outdoors shimano fenwick berkley vanish fluorocarbon slender spoon tutorial help need best greatest jigging spoon flutter spoon bait

walleye and smallmouth bass on bomber model 8a crankbait bomber model a 3" 1/2oz   finally got out fishing this year on the super hawk!  we got out right before dusk for a few hours, it was a blast, it was cool to see the super moon that night along with the sun setting, i tell you what there's nothing more beautiful than a sunset out on lake st. clair.  we got a double dose of pleasure that night from the great outdoors.    anyways, let's get down to business, i was trolling for muskie and northern pike, interchanging between a bucktail spinner and a big muskie crankbait on the left side.  while my friend on the right was trolling a bomber model 8a crankbait, the fishing lure has a yellowish belly with a brown top and brown scales.  i bought this crankbait about two years ago from either bass pro or lakeside fishing shop, anyways i looked online and can't seem to find the color anymore.  i hate when bomber discontinues a color.   i didn't get any hits on my line, but my friend caught a nice walleye and a few smallmouth bass.  i might of been embellishing each catch, but it's been a long time since i've been out fishing. my friend usually doesn't catch anything when he goes out, so this was quite the fishing expedition for him as well.  later that night, he said he caught more fish that day than he has in his whole life.  there's no doubt the trolling gives you better odds for catching fish.  i was just hoping that we could land a lunker, but i was happy that we just caught some beautiful fish from lake st. clair.  my previous fishing videos i've been recording with the go pro hd hero, much recently i bought a go pro hero 2.  so far i'm pleased with it!  it would've been nice to buy the go pro 3, but the company is having some problems with it.  and i really don't like the dark tint that i see in some of the go pro 3 videos, they must of added a filter to the lens.  some bloggers suggest the company rushed the go pro 3 camera onto the market, obviously to make more money.  so that's whyi bought the go pro hero 2, i needed a very dependable pov camera.  i'm not one of those people who cares about a little better definition in my videos.  since the go pro 2 has a mic input, i ordered up a sony ecm-ds70p microphone off amazon, not the bootleg ones that are being sold on ebay.  along with a reasonably priced windscreen from ebay.  hopefully the windscreen works well or i'm sending it back.  because i am so tired of hearing the wind distortion in my fishing videos.  so i'm praying to the fish gods that this windscreen blocks the wind out on the lake.  i used sony vegas 12 to edit the video.  the end result from the conversion and upload is not that bad, but doesn't do the camera justice.  the go pro footage looks amazing before it runs through conversion software.  if your computer and internet can handle it, click on the youtube button on the video that upgrades it to 1080p, it looks pretty good!  but it looks better before the upload.  we had a lot of glare out on the lake that day due to the sunset.  anyways i'm pretty pleased with the end result and happy i picked up a new go pro camera.  just can't wait to get out on the water again!   fishing tackle   lure:  bomber model a 3" 1/2oz    rod:   ugly stik elite spinning 6' medium    reel:   shimano sienna 2500rd    line:   10lb berkley trilene xt monofilament    camera:   gopro hd hero2 camera    about eternal angler   a great spot on the web where you can find me fishing at some of my favorite lakes in michigan. i try to give out helpful fishing tips on lures, fishing gear, and tackle. fishing is life, one of my favorite hobbies/sports to do on the weekend.  website    facebook    twitter    google plus    pinterest    walleye fishing smallmouth bass bass fishing bomber crankbait lake st. clair fishing

wigwam and kishkutena muskie fishing saturday and sunday october 9-10, 2010. from nestor falls, we went across kakabikitchewan lake up the river to pine lake, then up the river to wigwam lake, which involves two portages around waterfalls. we fished wigwam on saturday and caught six muskies in there. this is the third time we have fished wigwam. good numbers of muskies but nothing big. i think the largest we have caught out of there is 36 inches. we caught two 35's that day. on the way back down that evening, we left the boat above the first waterfall and used the ranger to get back to camp. the next morning we took the ranger back up river as far as the first waterfall again. we then went across the portage again into wigwam and then upstream about 2 1/2 miles more, which included portaging around two rapids, and pulling the boat over a huge beaver dam. it took the better part of three hours before we arrived at lake kishkutena, plus a lot of sweat and backbreaking work carrying boat, motor, etc. i had heard of people going in there before but i would not recommend it for a day trip! plus it is pretty trecherous, and if you broke a leg or something, i am not sure how loing it would be before someone found you... or what's left of you. kishkutena is a fly-in lake but we got in there without paying a pilot! on the way back down, we put the motor up and shot the rapids with the canoe paddles. one time we got turned sideways and the rushing current got a little dicey i thought we might swamp and lose all our stuff, but we made it through. by shooting the rapids we only had two portages (the waterfalls) instead of four. we only caught the 41-incher in kishkutena, but it was worth it for dawson to catch his best muskie so far. we did see a lot of fish, probably about a dozen that day. they were following but not biting. we got back to wigwam in time to try a couple trolling passes and caught a 28-incher and lost a 32 right at boatside. we were back out to the camp at dark and had a long drive home that night. quite an adventure on a spur of the moment trip. we decided to do it on thursday night and left on friday morning. dawson's website:  wigwam and kishkutena muskie fishing

sockeye salmon - underwater [hd] sockeye salmon (oncorhynchus nerka), also called red salmon or blueback salmon, is an anadromous species of salmon found in the northern pacific ocean and rivers discharging into it. there are also completely landlocked populations of the same species, which are known as the kokanee. sockeye salmon is the third most common pacific salmon species, after pink and chum salmon.the name "sockeye" is believed to be a folk adaptation of the anglicization of sqy, its name in halkomelem, the language of the indigenous people along the lower reaches of the fraser river. sockeye salmon ranges as far south as the columbia river in the eastern pacific (though individuals have been spotted as far south as the 10 mile river on the mendocino coast of california) and northern hokkaid island in japan in the western pacific, and as far north as bathurst inlet in the canadian arctic in the east and the anadyr river in siberia in the west. landlocked populations occur in the yukon territory and british columbia in canada, and in alaska, washington, oregon, california, new york, utah, idaho, montana, colorado, new mexico, and wyoming in the united states. nantahala lake is the only spot in north carolina where kokanee salmon are found. sockeye are blue tinged with silver in color while living in the ocean. just prior to spawning both sexes turn red with green heads and sport a dark stripe on their sides. males develop a hump on their back and the jaws and teeth become hooked during their move from salt to fresh water. sockeye spawn mostly in streams having lakes in their watershed. the young fish, known as fry, spend up to three years in the freshwater lake before migrating to the ocean. some stay in the lake and do not migrate. migratory fish spend from one to four years in salt water, and thus are four to six years old when they return to spawn one summer (july-august). navigation to the home river is thought to be done using the characteristic smell of the stream, and possibly the sun. some fish spend as long as four years in fresh water lakes before migrating. in rivers without lakes, many of the young move to the ocean soon after hatching. these salmon mature after one to four years in the ocean.  music: 'lost souls' by ensams   season of the red blueback salmon sockeye salmon pairs runs oncorhynchus nerka food fish kokanee trepanier creek spawning migration bed channel river stream land locked fishing life cycle roe eggs milt alevin fingerlings predators doe buck okanagan lake salmon fraser adams river conservation streams fisheries endangered species last minute cheap vacation package tours resorts shuswap lake hellobc jcvdude tourism sony hd 1080i hdr xr550 underwater nature wildlife videography kelowna bc

gord pyzer shares winter sonar secrets watch how easy it is to solve your winter sonar ice fishing woes once and for all!  one of the most positive changes in the winter ice fishing scene over the past few years has been the proliferation of heated huts and shelters.    everything from the lap-of-luxury ice bungalows, like the ones you can rent on lake nipissing and lake temagami, where you eat, sleep and fish out on the ice to the more modest ice fishing shelters that you can rent on any number of lakes throughout northeastern ontario:      many winter ice anglers also prefer the joy and freedom they get by hitching up their portable shelters to their snowmachines and atvs and exploring the thousands of pristine waterways via the elaborate system of carefully groomed trails that criss-cross the region.  unfortunately, however, while all good things don't have to come to an end, ice huts and shelters do come with their unique set of issues.  not the least of which is the interference that ice anglers get on their sonar units when they fish in holes only a few feet apart.  if you count yourself among the legion of ice anglers who pull out their hair and mutter under their breath while they try to tune out the unwanted sonar noise, have i got a trick for you. ontario canada tourism travel ice fishing gord pyzer

backcountry 2011 - severn river conservation reserve canoe route a canoe trip to the severn river provincial conservation reserve near bala, ontario completed in august of 2011. we parked at the nine mile lake marina and paddled down the upper portion of the gibson river into woodland lake and then brotherson's lake where we camped for the night. we returned via portages to turtle lake and back to nine mile lake. the upper gibson is very shallow and narrow in parts with rougher portages and this gets one away from the crowds that accompany many muskoka canoe routes.   watch in hd!  if you're looking for more info or anything specific like route maps or trip outlines, subscribe and send a message. river water park muskoka canoe trip backcountry stajanleafs severn river provincial conservation reserve canada ontario gibson woodland brotherson's turtle nine mile camping tent fishing bass portage wilderness nature summer weekend tourism backcountrytv brad jennings

catching a monster 51 inch northern pike (that was probably a muskie) this is a video of me catching the fish of my life with the help of my friend sam.    it was caught in the east end of lost bay on eagle lake on 18 lb braid with a silver 6 inch big doctor spoon.  we didn't weigh it, but it measured 51 inches long.   the internet community seems to think it was a muskie, which i'm certainly willing to believe. it was my first time fishing canada, and i'm definitely not an expert. it was still the biggest fish i'm ever likely to catch, ever. and only then because sam dove in the water to grab it!    skip to ~4:30 for the crazy part.  if we didn't get it on video i don't think anyone would believe the story.    a big thanks to everyone at eagle lake island lodge.  the accommodations were outstanding and i had the time of my life.  i cannot wait to go back.     fish fishing northern pike canada baitcaster eagle lake big huge monster

hd sea kayak fishing footage of catching, cleaning, and cooking a number of salmon over the course of a summer.   i'm certainly not an expert... but i do enjoy it.    catching a salmon from a sea kayak is an incredible experience.   you feel every wave, every tug on the line.  it can be tireing; it can be exilerating.   paddling into off-shore rock gardens at first light... cruising along empty shorelines.    primarily, i use a shimano trolling reel, on a shortened, stiff rod.  it is also possible to use a simple handline (fishing line wrapped around a stick).   since most of my fishing is done while on multi-day trips, i am generally using artificial lures (hoochies or buzz bombs).     please, respect the fish.  follow local fishing guidelines.  buy a fishing license.  catch only what you can eat.     liam mcneil is a proffessional sea kayak guide, based out of tofino, british columbia.  shot with a go-pro hd kayak fish kayak fishing kayak fish kayak trolling shimano salmon rockfish fish hook barb splash  see more at liammcneil.com high-definition video fishing sea kayak hd liam mcneil extream pacific ocean seaward current designs boat cook gut salmon extreme funny eggs fire camp tofino johnstone nootka go pro hd fish fish (food) food cooking liammcneil.com

successful fall walleye jigging tips successful jigging fall walleye really starts out with the right location.  search out those red hot spots from the summertime.  those spots where everyone crowds, but now are left vacant do to the cold weather.  these are likely the locations you will find some fall walleye concentrating on.  move around until you locate where a good number of fish are stacking up this fall.  they tend to be over rocky areas on points and mid lake humps, and steep drops.  start with these locations the next time you head out on the lake and you might land yourself a bunch of fish! walleye (organism classification) jigging (sports equipment) fall autumn fishing best awesome action success the fishing doctors adventures how to tutorial information demonstration tips tricks help tip michigan walleye central alberta canada north wild minnow bait big fat
how to scale a fish in seconds - pressure washer technique an incredibly fast, clean way to scale a bass, walleye ( pickerel) or any other scaly fish is shown.  if done right it will not bruise the fish's skin nor flesh.    use a pressure washer with a lower pressure nozzle ( green colour nozzle  ) starting at the tail on a low ( oblique) angle to lift scales.  be sure to "blow" the scales into a non-used grassy area where they will disappear in a day or two, or other place where a blast of water-borne scales is not an issue.  don't attract bears or raccoons with the smell of the scales etc!  first clamp the fish solidly to a plank or other surface by its tail .  then wash off scales in seconds.  you won't believe the results!    cooking a whole fish results in less waste and better nutrition due to the vitamins, minerals and omega fatty acids etc in the fat under the skin.  it also results in much better bone removal than one gets by filleting.  place the cooked fish on a platter on its side. start removing the flesh at the top half along backbone and lift the flesh upwards to reveal the skeleton, peel off the good "fillet" and then remove the skeleton lifting it out whole from the remaining other side of the flesh which is face down on the plate.  watch for small bones that remain as you eat!    i recommend clipping the tips off of the spiny needle fin bones of bass or walleye before starting to clean the fish to save your hands from wounds and also to protect the chef  while coating and cooking it.  the bass shown was a 2.5 lbs bass from the highlands of lanark county in ontario accessed by remote atv  (canada).  it was a spectacular fighter for its size and made an incredible meal when pan fried in the whole.  it was clean and perfect - no worms etc, as it was in a tiny, clean landlocked lake formed in the ice-age era. no cottages etc - nothing but pine forest and hills.  enjoy your easy cleaned fish!    signed bearfish of ontario  (bearfishontario@bell.net  -  not gmail )   by the way, my accent is from the eastern shore of nova scotia canada! how-to fish scale clean outdoor sports

trout jumping for worms ii all trout survived the winter! the ice was pretty thick on the pond this year and it was just last week when the final thin layer melted.  all trout look healthy and active.  they couldn't wait to get a feed of worms. the large trout are more reluctant to jump for worms than the smaller ones. the grass and other vegetation  is still brown as it is still early spring here.  these trout are brook or speckled trout but the local name often used is mud trout.  toutes les truites survcu  l'hiver! la glace tait assez paisse sur l'tang cette anne et c'tait juste la semaine dernire lorsque la dernire couche fine et fondue. toutes les truites une apparence saine et active. ils ne pouvaient pas attendre pour obtenir un flux de vers. les grosses truites sont plus rticents  sauter pour les vers que les plus petits. l'herbe et autre vgtation est encore brune comme il est encore au dbut du printemps ici. under water camera trout fishing trout brook trout mud speckled pond food worms red wigglers angling liner frog garden fish fishing rod lake fly fishing truite mouchete omble de fontaine boue vers la nourriture tang pche rouges grenouille jardin revtement poisson tige lac pche  la mouche nlinventor
alaska's best fishing lodge  we wouldn't call it a "...fishing lodge" if we couldn't provide the alaska halibut salmon fishing experience. a 300-pound halibut, though rare, isn't a dream. neither are those elusive 50-pound king salmon. more abundant are the fighting silver salmon that seem determined to tow your boat across icy straits. and, there's more!  pink salmon, chum salmon, and dolly varden (the fish, not the country singer) are always a good challenge, to say nothing of the rock fish, cod and other sea creatures vying for your attention (and eating your bait). with all these fish, you are virtually guaranteed a successful fishing experience. deep sea fishing outdoors wildlife sport fishing cooking classes site seeing fly fishing

pacific sanddab (flounder) fishing, gabriola island, bc - 720p hd will and i got bored of staring at the downriggers not doing anything... so we decided to take a break from trolling and catch some flatfish. these little guys are agressive so if they're there, you'll catch them. they'd be great fighters on ultralight gear, but it would be pretty hard to get split-shot down to 200ft. we just used our regular jigging rods, herring chunks for bait and 16oz. weights to combat the current. the best thing about catching sanddab is that they are really tasty. just gut 'em and fry 'em... delicious.  music by:  the arctic monkeys - brainstorm flounder flatfish fish fishing bc british columbia gabriola island vancouver canada thunder jet pacific sanddab jigging arctic monkeys

"remote wilderness" camping trip 2016 2 years ago we had an invite with our kayak fishing group to go explore a new spot.  we liked it so much that we shared our experience with our close friends who have kids the same age as ours, and we have now gone two consecutive years with them as well.  although the fishing wasn't as great this year as it has been in the past, the weather cooperated and we had a great weekend, for the third year in a row! it was a 2 hour drive, then a 2+ km drive to the lake, then loading all the gear onto kayaks and rafts for a 90 minute paddle to the remote island where the old cabin is located........ sounds a bit like the starting of almost every horror movie i've ever watched, but so far, so good! :) no running water, no electricity, no plumbing, just an outhouse and a roof to sleep under, but the lake is beautiful and holds several different species of fish (although pickerel are the true kings of this lake.  large boulders tower over you everywhere, and also hide just inches under the surface of the water, keeping motor boats out.  in the 3 years i've been there, i've only ever seen one other boat on the lake the same time as us, and they didn't seem to stay very long before they went back to the distant shoreline.  it's an isolated paradise...... noticed how i haven't said the location? ;) ***this is more of a video showing the beauty of this gem of a spot than it is a "fishing" video, although there are a few fish in here too. kayak fishing ascend fs12 kayak fishing pickerel family camping trip new brunswick canada

bass fishing on blue lake 2016 blue lake is located in the halliburton forest, which is about 45 minutes from minden or about 3.5 hours away from toronto. it is a small lake that is about 5 acres in size with a depth of 35 feet. the lake has plenty of small-mouth bass and some perch. it used to be stocked with rainbow trout, but they are scarce now. hopefully it gets re-stocked in the future. we had plenty of action with bass lures and mepps spoons with worms on them. gas motors are not permitted on this small lake. ice fishing is permitted and blue lake is right across the street from macdonald lake. it is about 270 kilometres (170 mi) northeast of toronto, and just south of algonquin provincial park.  i created this video with the youtube video editor ( youtube editor haliburton forest algonquin provincial park fishing brook trout blue lake macdonald lake wildcat lake no name lake dutton stocking lake act naturally channel brian kulchycki mark stamcoff minden camping trailer rentals boat launching splake rainbow trout mepps brown trout cottage rental swimming beach boating sail haliburton ontario beno tremble hook trouble hooks fishing accidents

2 reel fishing adventures - sooke, british columbia we went out for a full day of chinook (king, spring) salmon fishing with 2 reel fishing charters.      we can't explain how much fun we had with them and fishing guide ron neitsch. leaving the docks at sooke harbour resort and marina, early in the morning, we arrived at the fishing grounds 10 minutes later. the water was nice and calm, something not unusual in this area. no ground swells and large rollers like the open ocean.     we spent a full day with 4 large salmon on the gear but only 1 in the boat. i can tell you though that the fun is with the fish on, getting them to the boat is ideal, but it's certainly not disappointing.     the battles lasted anywhere from 3-8 minutes. the fight is intense and physical.     it was a blast. i will do it again with 2 reel fishing adventures in sooke, bc. located on vancouver island, just a 45 minute drive from downtown victoria, bc. salmon fishing pacific ocean sea charter bc british columbia vancouver island guide 2 reel adventures juan de fuca strait sooke chinook salmon king salmon spring salmon harbour resort secretary island fun excitement things to do boat downrigger hootchie flasher gear

mill lake 2012 this is a video log of our 7 day fishing trip to mill lake lodge.  mill lake lodge is located on the north shore of the georgian bay and is only accessible by water.  the fishing can be somewhat difficult in this area, but if weather and seasonal timing for the target species is correct, you can do quite well. the muskies, northern pike  and walleye's in this area are notoriously large.  as the 7 days go by we fished much of collins inlet, mill lake, beaverstone bay and beyond. we did have 2 days that were not productive. due to high winds as cold fronts moving through the area. we did not catch any true lunkers, but we each had a large musky on our lines; john's musky was certainly in the 50 inch class. but both muskies jumped, through the lures and swam away.  we caught approximately 50 pike and 1 largemouth bass. but in our minds it is not necessarily the number and size of the fish! one or two fish a day pleases us; but it is the exceptionally beautiful vistas, the huge wilderness of waterways and islands, the viewing of a variety of wildlife on foot ,wings and fins, the warm hospitality of the local people and lodge staff, these are priceless memories, along with the big fish that got away!!! in this video you will note at various times, a skeleton of a sunken steam ship, the location of the ghost town community of collins inlet, and the remains of the lumber mills wooden pier. i have included a historical discription of the ghost town in the followling paragraphs. lumbering began in the area of collins inlet around the year 1865 when the province of ontario opened up rights to harvest lumber in the area. in 1868 a small sawmill named the collins inlet lumber company began operating out of the area. the mill's specialty was producing wood, cut from the la cloche mountain range, to be used for laths, boxes and for ship building.  lumber was stored in large piles in the backwoods during the winter until spring, when the lumber could be floated down the mahzenazing river. twice a week steamer ships docked at the inlet to load lumber, unload mail and supplies. during the winter the site was completely isolated.  the collins inlet lumber co. was taken over in 1886 by john bertram. by that time the site had grown to include a boarding house, homes, store and a school. mr. bertram increased the size of the mill and added a 100-foot high sawdust burner. the older homes, which were poorly constructed, were replaced with more modernized homes.  a boat works and post office were later built at the site.   the collins inlet post office saw erratic activity. first opened in 1869, the office closed in 1877 and remained closed until 1883. in 1883 it was reopened and served as a full-time post office until 1938 when it was used solely as a summer office. the post office finally closed for good in 1945  as of today, one old building remains and is dilapidated. the old boarding home is long gone and replaced by the now idle mahzenazing river lodge. inside the lodge are some old pictures and an aerial picture showing what the entire site once looked like.  the city of london, a ship built in 1865, sank off the shore in 1875 and can still be seen in the waters today.  john bertram died in 1904. his lumber mill continued after his death, until 1918 when it was destroyed by fire. after the fire the machinery was salvaged for the war effort, the town abandoned. the company schooner was scuttled (flooded).   the lumbering activity continued in the area well into the 1930's. mill lake lodge georgian bay killarney philip edward island toad island collins inlet beaverstone bay mill lake musky northern pike walleye fishing

trout spawning in natural environment. hd video. hd video of trout spawning in markham ontario stream. two males competing for the right to reproduce with one female. i'm not sure what kind they are but because they were spawning in the spring, i'm guessing they might be rainbows.  during the spawning season, fish become more difficult to see. from above, female backs are exactly the same shade as nest gravel. even males are well-disguised from the top, although their sides remain colorful.  females swish their tails to hollow out a spot in the gravel. while they are making their nests, males are gathering around.  males often fight and it isn't unusual to see males with chewed-off tails, missing eyes or body punctures! some die of their wounds.  during spawning, the hens drop low in their nests and  eject eggs. meanwhile, the male sprays milt (sperm).  the eggs that drop into the nest are fertilized.  the hen quickly swishes gravel over the eggs, to hide them from predators. this may be repeated several times, eggs stacking in layers with gravel.  with small trout, the spawning may only take a day or two; for larger trout, about 5 days is the norm.  females produce about 400 eggs per pound of their weight (for example: an 8 ounce female would produce a total of about 200 eggs during spawning season).  after about 3 months, the tiny fish leave the nest and strike out on their own. trout spawning reproduction fertilization educational ontario female male fish fishing rainbow canon 5d ii mating markham unionville ontario

sockeye salmon - kokanee spawning in  sony hd locals know that the best spot for seeing sockeye salmon - land locked kokanee salmon spawning in the okanagan is near peachland in trepanier creek.  we went and checked mission creek and its's man made spawning channel and found fewer and smaller  fish, with the man made appearance overwhelming. i wonder why kelowna couldn't just let the fish spawn in mission creek as the koanee have for eons before white man decided that we could improve on nature.  some sockeye live and reproduce in lakes and are called "kokanee", a word in the okanagan language for this kind of fish. they are much smaller than the ones that go to the ocean and are rarely over 350 millimetres (14 in) long. in okanagan lake and many others there are two kinds of kokanee populations - one spawns in streams and one spawns in the lake near the shore. as an aside, the kokanee glacier gets its name from kokanee creek, which enters kootenay lake near nelson, british columbia. music: dance of midnight by hunterfoxz @looperman   season of the red blueback salmon sockeye salmon pairs runs oncorhynchus nerka food fish kokanee trepanier creek spawning migration bed channel river stream land locked fishing life cycle roe eggs milt alevin fingerlings predators doe buck okanagan lake salmon fraser adams river conservation streams fisheries endangered species last minute cheap vacation package tours resorts shuswap lake hellobc jcvdude tourism sony hd 1080i hdr xr550 underwater nature wildlife videography kelowna bc

rise of the salmon people (trailer)     wild salmon feed the people and economies of countless communities in british columbia, both inland and coastal. the fraser river watershed births the largest run of sockeye salmon on earth, yet in 2009, only 1 million of the expected 13 million sockeye returned to the fraser river to spawn. now, perhaps for the first time, diverse communities in bc are coming together with a common goal -- to save wild salmon. first nations communities, environmentalists, tourism industries, and fishing villages are uniting and uprising.    wild salmon are not only an endangered icon of british columbia; they are the backbone of this province, ecologically and economically. decades of overfishing by commercial fisheries, destruction of spawning habitat by clear-cut logging, hydro-electric dams, and more recently, fish farms on the coast have had catastrophic impacts to the wild salmon in bc. salmon fishing native aboriginal bc canada fraser river lillooet hope vancouver alexandra morton fin donnelly canoe paddle raft hells gate chilliwack sockeye adams river fraser sockeye wild salmon

post spawn tactics for northwestern ontario musky three days into the 2013 musky season in northwestern ontario (opens the 3rd saturday in june), mike grant and heinrich bier of giant quest spent 2 days fishing and filming on a small lake. while fishing the likely spawning areas they were only able to contact male musky, meaning the fish were likely done spawning.  ice-off and the spring season came to a slow start in northwestern ontario. on larger water bodies like lotw some fish were still in pre-spawn and/or spawn mode. giant quest would to stress that it is important not target large females that have not completed spawning, regardless of whether the season is open or not. many management jurisdictions in the usa allow fishing for pre-spawn and spawning muskies, but it is important to note that most states have significant stocking programs. in northwestern ontario, we have to rely on a self-sustaining population, hence the season opening after the fish are done spawning in late june. however, years like 2013 (and 2014 will even later) mother nature is behind and the legal date doesn't work to protect the fish. it is up to us to be diligent and think critically about which fish we target. giant quest musky muskie muskellunge mike grant heinrich bier northwestern ontario fishing dadson blade baits shimano

a caplin scull, sandy cove, newfoundland and labrador (by peter bull, newfoundland) this past saturday, ronan, cormac my dad and i went to sandy cove on the eastport peninsula to see if the caplin were rolling. we were in luck! the caplin scull is an amazing sight worth seeing and a lot of fun. these small fish migrate from the deep ocean and spawn on the beach. for centuries, newfoundlanders and labradorians have taken this opportunity to catch these fish as they roll in the coves and bays around the province. they make for a great meal, but are also prized as fertilizer on vegetable gardens. this was ronan and cormac's first time seeing the caplin roll and they had a blast. it took a while to figure out the best way to catch them, but by the end we were catching them with our hands. newfoundland noodling! fresh caplin fried for breakfast the next day was a great treat. there is no set date to witness this natural spectacle, but it generally happens in late june and early july. capllin scull peter bull sandy cove eastport peninsula newfoundland and labrador newfoundland peterabull ronan and cormac fishing catching fish by hand caplin happy adventure eastport noodling

kid screams while she catches huge 40" northern pike by herself fishing in canada freaked out young girl catches huge pike listen to this girl scream! fish on tight lines catch and release catching northern pike  while fishing in canada my kids and i were trolling.  my daughter hooks into the first fish of the trip and it was the biggest one we caught during the 12 days of our trip.  at first i thought it was just a normal fish, but then it starts taking line.  i quickly hooked the pole to a double sided caribiner bungee cord just in case she were to drop the pole.  she screamed cried and yelled a whole bunch.  i see she even cinched down on the line a few times, but it didn't break.  i tried to get line out so she could move it over to me to unhook, but she was so freaked out she kept reeling it all back in.  in the end we got it and let it go.  it was just over 38 inches.  this was the first fish pike she has ever hooked up and caught!  my biggest is an inch shorter and i've been pounding the water pretty hard for close to 40 years.  it was nice this summer traveling to a few lakes i know had some decent fish.  i know there are bigger ones on there, but it sure was a nice fish.  people on the other side of the lake could hear her yelling and screaming.  we were near a campground and they were all cheering.  by the time we got it all the lines were reeled in and we had drifted up to shore.  we were using barbless hooks which made the unhooking easier, but the lure had 3 treble hooks on it and it was pretty scary reaching down to pick it up.  i think i will change the front hooks to singles.  she was a real champ and after she caught it had a pole in her hand pretty much the whole trip.  she hooked up on a bunch more fish all on her own.  she helped teach my other two kids how to cast and was a real pro out there.  my son learned and caught several fish on his own.  he even caught a 32" lake trout which i would guess weighed 12-15 pounds.  he battled it on his own.  my daughter helped balance the pole off the side of the boat.  i will be posting that as well.  it was fun to let the kids experience the fish and i didn't really care if they got off.  my goal was to let them get it done on their own. catching big pike catching pike on lures catching pike on spoons catching pike with minnows catching pike with sucker fathead leech shiner trout bass sunfish bluegill walleye laker fishing from a boat end up on shore fishing catching pike in a pond catching pike in a river system catching huge pike monster northern pike for a little kid northern pike fishing northern pike attacks northern pike attack northern pike northern pike eat duck frogs snails bugs and other fish including themselves cannibals fishing in canana ontario mason lake  saskatchewan british columbia yukon territory northwest territory alberta quebec up north big fish little kid wisconsin gryga fishing in minnesota bailey lake bwca boundary waters canoe area fishing in michigan new york pennsylvania montana jeff fishing out lake fly catch michigan northern pike (animal) big bass largemouth bass (organism classification) river rapids trout salmon fish (animal) esox (organism classification) canada scary funny scared scream weird you can fix it!!!! jgryga

a few of the most enterprising ones are aided by domesticated otters, which behave like shepherds, swimming underwater, driving fish toward the fisherman's net (and being rewarded themselves with a share of the catch). fish for local consumption are generally of freshwater varieties  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  bangladesh marine fisheries academy: """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" bangladesh marine fisheries academy(bmfa)[1] is a government-run training institution in bangladesh for cadets wishing to enter the fishing industry, merchant shipping and other related maritime industries.[2] established in 1973, it is the only national organization offering training for these professions.  it started as juldia marine academy in juldia, chittagong in 1962.[3] the present academy started its journey as a project of bangladesh fisheries development corporation (bfdc) on 1 september 1973 and on 20 april 1988 it came under the administrative control of ministry of fisheries and livestock as a project.[2] but on 1 july 1993 the academy was transferred to revenue budget under the same ministry.[2] since then the academy is functioning under the administrative control of the ministry. the functional authority of the academy is vested on the principal who has three assisting organs namely academic council, board of studies and board of discipline.   .................................................................................................................                                 keyword world amazing fishing ................................................................................................................. b. h. fisher - bag limits - bait act - bait fish - bamboo fly rod - bangladesh marine fisheries academy - bank fishing - banks dory - basa fish - basnig - bass anglers sportsman society - bass boat - bass festival - bass fishing - bassmaster classic - bay mud - bayou la batre, alabama - beach casting - bennett spring state park - benthic zone - benthos - bering sea arbitration - best angler espy award - bibliography of fly fishing - big hole river - big-game fishing - billingsgate fish market - bioeconomics - bioluminescence - biomass (ecology) - bite alarm - blast fishing - blast fishing - blue cod - blue grenadier - blue mussel - bluefish - bobs farm, new south wales - boilie - bombarda - bonefish - bottom feeder - bottom fishing - bottom trawling - bowfishing - braided fishing line - brixham - broodstock - brook trout - brown trout - bruno hofer - bureau of fisheries and aquatic resources (philippines) - busan cooperative fish market - bsum - by-catch   a pobra do caramial - a river somewhere - abalone - abu garcia - age class structure - agriculture in libya - agriculture, fisheries and conservation department - agulhas bank - akebono maru - alaskan king crab fishing - alexander neil mclean - algaculture - algal bloom - allan marcus atkinson mclean - ama divers - amadou - american angler - american angler - american lobster - list of american fishers - american museum of fly fishing - american plaice - amwell magna fishery - anchovy - ancient hawaiian aquaculture - andrea gail - androscoggin river - angling - angling in yellowstone national park - angling records in the uk - angling records of europe - anguillidae - animas river - aquaculture - aquaculture engineering - aquaponics - aquatic ecosystem - arctic char - arctic corsair - arctic grayling - argungu fishing festival - arizona game and fish department - arkansas unique fishing techniques how to catch fish amazing fishing moment fishing in a lake fishing in a small lake lake bass fishing amazing fishing moments fishing funny fishing fish bmfa bangladesh fisheries bangladesh marine fisheries academy amazing big fishing videos                         carl and alex fishing in bangladesh fishing in chad

how to catch jumbo perch on reef runner cicada the reef runner cicada, especially in its larger sizes may not strike you as a go to perch lure.  let me tell you though it has a perch catching ability like some of the best perch lures out there.  this lure triggers aggressive behavior in larger perch that are often turned off and difficult to entice a bite from.  the other great feature is small perch often shy away from the size of this lure and its intense vibration and flash.  this leaves you with more time in the water able to catch those larger jumbo perch that are often waiting on the side lines.  the secret is you only want to bait the front hook and not so much so that the action is killed.  you still want that tight intense vibration on sharp jigs that brings fish in from distance as it hits their lateral line and warns them about an easy meal near by.  both meal worms and pieces of a minnow tend to work well.  a bonus feature during the night bite is that this is also a great lure for catching those walleye on the prowl.   give it a try next time you're on the ice!  the title was created with  jumbo perch yellow perch (organism classification) fish fishing michigan sumo perch monster perch giant perch huge perch reef runner cicada glow in the dark fishing tips tricks hints secrets tips help how-to (media genre) tutorial the fishing doctor adventures alberta canada ontario night strike amazing best awesome action great
eskimo shark z 71 cc most powerful ice auger on earth click link for a great deal on an eskimo ice auger -    this was a mighty cold day on the ice... -30 degrees celsius.  usually this shark starts in 2-3 easy pulls.  here you can see it still wasn't too bad to cold start at 10 pulls and the first few didn't really look like i was trying.  this is a cold start and straight to drilling a 10 inch hole in 24 inches of ice.  it's a little smokey since the gas was mixed a bit rich on the first tank.  usually should be 50:1 oil mixture.  this beast is 34 pounds but it feels like it will cut through anything without hesitation.  lots of power.  the shark z 51 cc would probably be plenty for most people.  this is what you should expect from your eskimo if you decide to buy one.  i used it for 5 weeks this season drilling tons of holes and it works amazing!  highly recommend an eskimo.  my dad purchased this one and we're really happy with it. eskimo ice auger review shark z71cc z 71cc z 71 cc biggest best awesome cutting fast amazing cold start demonstration the fishing doctor tips tricks how to rate powerful best in the world

how to catch a jawjacker walleye this winter i was determined to catch a walleye on a jawjacker, but i knew it might be a challenge.  i seem to loose half the ones i hook on my own line, never mind one that is sitting dead stick on its own.  so after a few missed strikes i came up with the flasher jig and minnow combination with two stinger hooks.  i think this is overkill and i think you would get away with just one stuck in the tail of the minnow.  after all all the ones that i actually got up the hole were hooked well with the main jig anyways and i didn't even need the treble stingers.  anyways check out my demo on how the jaw jacker can help you catch more walleye this ice season.  good luck out there.  this is the first youtube video catching walleye on the jaw jacker.  the title was created with  jawjacker jaw jacker ice fishing best walleye fishing (tv genre) fish how to tips trick information demonstration help catch more bigger huge monster fat big eye pickeral automatic fisherman dead stick jig and minnow icefishing the fishing doctor adventure

how to ice fishing brook trout with spoons ice fishing for eastern brook trout can be a lot of fun especially during the early ice season.  first ice is a great time to be out fishing as long as you are careful when heading out.  we recommend not venturing out until the ice is at least 4 inches thick.  once your local brook trout pond freezes over you can use the tips in this video to locate brook trout and convince them to bite even on the slow days.  in this video i was using a marcum vx - 1 pro and a silver and red slender spoon 1/8 oz tipped with a small piece of cocktail shrimp.  these brook trout are stocked as all female triploids so they do not display normal spawning behavior and therefore fishing varies a bit for these fish early ice from the usual diploid spawning brook trout.  these lakes are often heavily stocked so don't feel bad if you'd like to take something home to eat that is the reason these fish are put in the lakes.  best of luck to you on the ice this season! brook trout eastern brook trout ice fishing how to howto how to fish spoon fishing slender spoon shrimp bait marcum marcum vx tips greatest best information help merritt fishing with rod worlds best pond stocked trout need catch catching hooked flasher sonar education understanding char fishing teacher fishing doctor british columber interior sportfishing bc sportfishing outdoors amazing survival skills bass largemouth

nice brook trout caught skating caddis dry fly   this past weekend i got some decent footage of a nice sized brook trout  taking a caddis dry fly pattern i was skating. while i catch less trout skating a dry fly than on a dead drift, the trout i do catch tend to be larger, more aggressive, and fight harder than those that take a dead drifted fly.  skip to 1:13 if you want to see the fly highlighted and the strike slowed down.  if you watch the fly in the video above, you'll see that it's dead drifted over the fish first, and i only trigger a strike as i'm skating the fly back to me. i like the let the fly dead drift down the current first. when the drift is completed, i'm not to eager to rip the fly up for another cast right away. instead, i like to skate the fly back towards myself before casting. this helps cover more water using two different techniques with less casting, and reduces the likelihood of spooking the fish. trout brook trout flyfishing fishing pei prince edward island spring caddis skating dry fly fly fishing dryfly

charlie boy hopper another outstanding pattern by master tier, charlie craven.  here's an excerpt from his website, charlie's flybox, about the charlie boy hopper:    "i developed this pattern several years ago while guiding on colorado's tarryall creek. my clients were going through dave's hoppers at an astounding rate and i figured there had to be a better option. while dave's fly works fine, it becomes waterlogged after a couple fish and is a pain to tie. the charlie boy hopper (named after my son) meets all of my requirements in a hopper pattern: active rubber legs, incredible durability, realistic silhouette, good visibility, and great flotation. the best part is it is especially easy to tie. i like to fish charlie boys in the standard tan color, as it seems to be the most common color of the naturals, as well as in yellow, green, olive and even blue/green. the blue/green color (with red rubber legs) matches the hoppers found in the hay meadows along many of our mountain streams here in colorado. the charlie boy hopper also works great as an indicator dry with a dropper. its high visibility and superior flotation make it a natural for this application."     hopper charlie boy craven terrestrial pattern foam elk hair dry fly tying flytying flyfishing fishing southern alberta flies rainbow brown cutthroat brook bull lake trout

vancouver island crab fishing - the whole adventure a family friend took us along to go retrieve his crab pots so we could have fresh seafood for supper that night. it was quite the experience for this flatlander!  the process goes like this: boat out to gps waypoint (that was set when the pots were dropped) hook the buoy with a pole, pull it in, along with the nearly 120' of leaded rope, pull the pot into the boat. remove the crabs from the trap, measure them to ensure they are legal to keep (toss the ones that aren't), re-bait the pot, then return the pot to the water.   once we get back to the marina, we used a "guillotine" to split the crabs right at the dock. this allows us to clean the crabs right away and keep the mess out of the kitchen.    this is the 6 minute "full" crabbing adventure. more shots, more stuff happening. for a more condensed version, check out my other video; it's just the good stuff. vancouver island (geographical feature) crab (animal) fishing gopro (award-winning work) ocean (geographical feature category) canada action british columbia (canadian province)

brook trout ice fishing canada quality brook trout ice fishing canada.  brook trout are one of the sought after fish in canada while ice fishing.  usually brook trout live in shallow ponds that have a muddy bottom and a weedy shoreline.  they are very aggressive feeders during the winter months and thrive in cold water.  typically fish for brook trout in 3'-6' of water in and amongst the weeds or structure.  in shallow water they can become very sensitive to noise above the ice or movement. for more information about brook trout fishing canada visit  brook trout ice fishing canada brook trout ice fishing canada british columbia large brook trout pemberton fish finder ice fishing brook trout
2015 - 2016 pemberton fish finder ice fishing season is a wrap 2015-16 pemberton fish finder ice fishing season is a wrap.  first of all the team at pemberton fish finder would like to thank all of our clients for a fun, entertaining, safe and successful ice fishing season.  although it pains me to put my ice fishing equipment away, i'm excited for the fly fishing and open water season to begin.  we shared tons of stories, made lots of new friends and made lots of lifelong memories.  the addition of a couple new pemberton fish finder employees allowed us to accommodate larger corporate groups.  i would also like to thank my beautiful wife, melissa knowles for answering the phone, emails and coordinating the teams schedules.  melissa's job is a thankless job, but without her we would not have been nearly as successful as we were.  our group of professional ice fishing guides took people ice fishing from all over the world.  it was interesting to say the least to see people walk on to a frozen lake for the first time.  the question arose regularly "is the ice safe?" my reply was typically it's holding me up, you'll be ok.  anyone that knows me would know that i'm a big boy, that ways in at 280 lbs and most of my clients weigh roughly half of what i do.  it was amazing how many people could not believe that i would be their host for the day after sitting at home watching our fishing videos on youtube.  they soon found out that i was a normal dude with an exceptional ability to catch fish and put my clients on fish too.  poor james in the picture below was one of those guys that was star shocked but a quick hug brought him back down to earth.  in the video below we announce the end of the ice fishing season and share a few fond memories from the past ice fishing season.  not many people know this but i'm a rapper and the tune in the video is non other than brad knowles himself.  lets just say i'm not going to give up on my day job anytime soon.  our next ice fishing will commence december 15th, 2016.  call melissa today and book your spot for ice fishing on the up coming season.   ice fishing pemberton fish finder hardwater fishing brad knowles things to do in whistler things to do in british columbia winter activity things to do in pemberton

port huron water intake, fish how many of you know where port huron michigan is? before the 1920's, it was a happening place. our history was relevant. you can't open up a great lakes shipping book and not read about port huron. lately, things have been stale. big things have been announced like casinos, bridge plaza expansions, and some others, only to have them fizzle away. while we were all chipping away at survival and possibilites, mother nature has been delivering gifts to the area. at first..., we thought she was delivering a social disease in the form of those communist zebra mussels. then it was the gobies, courtesy of the venerial nature of international shipping. the great lakes met the challenges and some of the side effects are clearer waters and a new source food for some of our species creating greater sizes and numbers. because i dive these waters exclusively, i was able to watch the changes happening before my eyes. that's when i came to the conclusion that we could build some things to take advantage of these changes. believe me, i figured out the structure before i ever figured out how to build it. i know how to build it now, and quite ingeniously too. it's called below the blue . the foundation of the structure is a 45' wide x 15' tall window looking into our new st. clair river. we will see and hear the many things that are moving through our river. now, the challenge is gathering groups that need a home. fishing, shipping, diving, marine biology, etc. to start a snowball effect of excitement and energy to build their new home. some wealthy "1 percenter" is out there with the capital to build this. you may even know one. you may even be one. it will be the place to travel for year round healthy entertainment, and an escape from winter. it's at an international border crossing, it will take advantage of natural resources free, and the people needed to build it are already here. get me an audience with your 1 percenter, all of your 1 percenters. it's to your advantage! port huron fishing scuba diving port huron initiative st. clair county walleye walleyes walleye fishing brian martin port huron st. clair county

lake erie ice fishing trip march 7,  2014 this is another great trip to lake erie to ice fish for some big walleye.  our group is still fairly new to lake erie ice fishing so we are still learning.  safety is the main thing. the ice was in great shape at 20-22 inches thick.  we ran out 8-10 miles towards west sister island.  the morning bite was very slow with only a couple of fish caught.  we kept moving and finally got into some fish around mid day.  the bite really heated up from 2-4 pm.  we each kept our limit of eater size walleye.  we caught several larger fish up to almost 10 pounds. ice fishing walleye lake erie dime daughter sebile vibrato ice fishing lake erie ice fishing walleye fishing jigging

rainbow trout underwater ice fishing gopro hero the fish are not always where you expect to find them.  this day i noticed i wasn't getting any bites near the bottom and i saw a lot of aquatic bugs right under the ice.  so i started to jig right under the ice over ten feet of water and looked down the hole.  to my surprise fish were swimming right under my hole checking out the bait and even striking at it once in a while.  this was pretty cool so i drilled a couple of holes and stuck my gopro down to see what i could catch.  there was lots of snow on ice and this was late in the day so the lighting isn't the best but still pretty interesting to see their near ice behavior in the winter.  the ones i caught and filleted were full of these water bugs and sticklebacks.  title created with   youtube creation tools audio library song: "the wrong time" underwater ice fishing rainbow trout cool amazing alberta canada edmonton hermitage park pond winterkill fishing fishing doctor best awesome amazing footage gopro hero
best rainbow trout ice fishing tips with jaw jacker fishing hermitage park pond for rainbow trout under the ice is always something i like to try when home for christmas.  this is late in the season for these rainbows and sometimes they aren't very active as the oxygen levels in the lake fall.  i got out to the lake around sunrise although it was cloudy so i didn't see it.  i wasn't getting any hits in a usual spot so i moved across the pond to another spot.  right around noon i had the first hit on the jaw jacker and lost him at the hole.  lowered back down and soon had a nice 16 inch rainbow.  i underestimated in the video at 14 inches.  after that the bites were on and off.  but must have had 15 fish on the line and hits on the jaw jacker but only ended up getting four on the ice.  it was a lot of fun.  check out the video for all the details and how you can catch more fish at hermitage park pond.  get out there before they winterkill.  the action was fast and furious in the afternoon. rainbow trout (organism classification) tips tricks information help hermitage park pond edmonton alberta canada ice fishing fishing tutorial need advice best awesome amazing great hint secret pond (geographical feature category) winterkill stocked underwater tip up

understanding walleye underwater behavior ice fishing the jaw jacker underwater walleye behavior while ice fishing using a jaw jacker.  to get this video i just sent a gopro down to watch what would go on  while i had a jaw jacker set up.  this was a super slow day.  so much so we didn't think there were many fish around.  that was until i reviewed the footage and saw many fish swim by without even giving notice to the bait.  then there were those that would just come in for a look and others that would just nudge the bait.  finally did get one to inhale the bait on the jaw jacker.  learned a very important lesson that on these slow neutral days a minnow on the bottom was more likely to attract a bit.  so the next  trip my uncle headed out with a jig and minnow, then a few inches of line and a single hook below.  attach a minnow to both and send down.  let the bottom minnow lay on the bottom.  the next time he went out the fish were in a similar mood, but the jaw jacker caught 90% of the fish and all of them were on that bottom minnow on the bottom.  so this really is a highly effective method of jaw jacker fishing for walleye especially on those tough days. give it a try and don't forget to comment below, like and subscribe! walleye (organism classification) fishing (tv genre) michigan behavior (quotation subject) lake underwater ice fishing jaw jacker amazing incredible best educational help tips tricks gopro hero under water jig and minnow stinger catch monster huge jigging (sports equipment) walleye fishing tip catch more fish canada alberta pigeon lake alberta (lake) information research angler professional angler

shocking underwater jaw jacker northern pike friday the 13th underwater video of the jaw jacker in action on a very tough day of fishing march friday the 13th.  the weather was beautiful warm, calm and sunny but the fish were in an ultra negative mood.  so much so we thought there weren't any fish in the area from watching our marcum.  turns out there were lots of fish in our area and instead of our jigging action pulling fish in to the bait it was actually turning them off before they were even seen on the  sonar.  this is where the jaw jacker's were excelling.  i learned a few things from this video.  the pike were getting off because i had a light line on the rod and reel so i think the monofilament was stretching too much to get a good hook set.  also since the fish were in such a negative mood they wouldn't even fight after the hook set so they would create their own slack and just spit the hook.  so on slow days it really does call for a jaw jacker rigged with braided line, a good stiff rod and loaded with lots of tension.  that way the fish will hopefully still be there when you get to the rod on those slow fishing days.  check out the video i learned a lot from watching it after and hope you do too.  northern pike behavior on an off fishing day. northern pike (animal) friday the 13th (film subject) fishing ice fishing jaw jacker jawjacker jackfish jack walleye pickerel muskie jaws educational shocking amazing underwater gopro hero minnow jig fish how to tips tricks informtation pigeon lake alberta big pike huge pike huge northern pike monster pike 40 inch pike 50 inch pike canada jigging (sports equipment) marcum

phantom-fishing by dji phantom 3 ( drone fishing ) for fish that fight back !! something i've wanted to try for some time became possible without the question:  "is this legal??"  stopped by my friend's private trout pond for a try at "drone fishing" or "phantom fishing" with my dji phantom 3 pro multi-rotor "flying camera". the fish were more cautious than i thought they would be as i believe the flying uav overhead probably resembled the ospreys and eagles that take shots at them from time to time. there was a certain amount of risk in not knowing if the phantom could lift even the smallest fish at 12+ inches.  even more risky was the fact that there were some 5 and 8 pound hold-over "lunkers" in the pond too..  the first good strike was from a medium sized trout that yanked the line and bobber right out of the "safety" clip.  there was a very real possibility that i would have to dive in the pond to save the phantom as there were no boats that could be used to save the phantom if i hooked "troutzilla". i searched for other drone fishing videos but could only find several with a minnow that looked like it was already dead and a few with palm sized or smaller sunfish, bluegills or similar fish that seem to give up when you lift them out of the water..  i wanted to see some real fishing with fish that you would actually consider having for dinner...  fish that could fight back !! :-) drone fishing drone dji phantom trout pond private pond unmanned aerial vehicle (aircraft type) fishing (tv genre) trout curt 2ply curt long port angeles

the return of the salmon 2016 the return of the salmon: an award-winning documentary facebook:  website:   each summer, millions of salmon conclude their lifelong odyssey in alaskan rivers. it is salmon that bring life to their natal streams. while swimming upstream, they stop feeding. from the forest to the animals that live there, salmon provide essential nutrients and food. many species harvest the seasonal bounty, including bears, wolves, eagles and ravens. this is a journey no salmon survive, for once they have spawned, they die. each year we catch millions of salmon from the tongass national forest in southeast alaska. salmon support thousands of alaskan livelihoods. they are central to the alaskan way of life. salmon are the lifeblood of alaska.  alaskan cruise tourists can choose wildlife watching as a cruise excursion when they come ashore. watching bears catching salmon is one of the most popular things to do in alaska for tourists. most tourists take a cruise up the inside passage and disembark at the southeast alaska stops of sitka, juneau or ketchikan. tour operators offer popular brown bear viewing excursions to nearby "abc" islands. admiralty, baranof and chichagof islands are famous for their grizzly bear inhabitants.   there is one animal that draws the most significant amount of tourists from the lower 48 to southeast alaska.  each summer thousands of fishermen make their pilgrimage to fish the rivers of the tongass national forest. the pacific salmon returning from the ocean on their spawning migration are the catch of the day.   five species of pacific salmon return to alaska each summer: the pink or humpy, chum, coho, sockeye and chinook. each year commercial fishing fleets catch close to 50 million salmon. 120,000 sports fishermen catch 1 million salmon as they return to the rivers of southeast alaska. these statistics help us understand the significance of the salmon run to the local economy. without the return of the salmon, one of nature's great events, alaska would be a different place.   during tim plowden's trip to the alaska he realised it was all about the return of the salmon. he decided to create this short natural history documentary about the final stage of the salmons life cycle. their migration to the waters of their birth to spawn is an epic story.   a score composed and performed by christel veraart accompanies tim plowdens footage. new narration in this 2016 version is by seasoned voice over professional kevin o'connell.  awards: "best of alaska award" 2015 alaska international film awards; "award of merit"  2015 indiefest film awards.  official selections:  2015 british documentary film festival; 2015 international kuala lumpur eco film festival; voices from the waters international traveling film festival in india; and just announced - 2016 wildlife conservation film festival in new york!   if you would like to keep up-to-date with my latest photos, videos and news, please follow me online:  facebook:   pinterest:   instagram:   twitter:   website:   google +:   thank you for watching, please don't forget to subscribe to my youtube channel:    return of the salmon the return of the salmon the return of the salmon movie salmon (ingredient) fish (animal) fishing (tv genre) alaska salmon salmon spawning alaska (us state) sockeye salmon red salmon pink salmon salmon documentary salmon movie salmon run grizzly bear bears catching salmon bear documentary bear (animal) brown bear (animal) versus journey epic nature natural history animals wildlife travel cruise excursions nature's great events

easy catch fishing rod for more information go to  (full description below - click show more)  the easy catch rod does all the work!  the combination of a spring loaded hinge and a balancing force provided by the indicator assembly enhances the efficiency of the fishing rod. the spring loaded hinge and the pivoting arm allow the fish to drag the bait downward.  this allows the fish to pull the fishing line freely for a distance of approximately 1 foot, and when the arm member reaches the end of its range of movement, then the fish's pulling on the line draws the line taut which is usually enough to set the hook in the fish's mouth. the reflector tilts upward in unison with the folding of the arm into a near vertical orientation to indicate the likelihood that a fish has been caught. for typical ice fishing, a fishing line rated at 50 lb strength has been found to be suitable. notice: for deep sea fishing a line of 80 to 100lb test is recommended.  when the user is ready to pack up, he or she simply reels or winds the fishing line up and pushes down the arm member so that it folds against the mast. for even more compact storage, the indicator assembly can be removed. advantageously, no tools are required for assembly or disassembly.  for more information go to  fishing

fishing rod for more information go to        the easy catch rod does all the work!    the combination of a spring loaded hinge and a balancing force provided by the indicator assembly enhances the efficiency of the fishing rod. the spring loaded hinge and the pivoting arm allow the fish to drag the bait downward.    thos allows the fish to pull the fishing line freely for a distance of approximately 1 foot, and when the arm member reaches the end of its range of movement, then the fish's pulling on the line draws the line taut which is usually enough to set the hook in the fish's mouth. the reflector tilts upward in unison with the folding of the arm into a near vertical orientation to indicate the likelihood that a fish has been caught. for typical ice fishing, a fishing line rated at 50 lb strength has been found to be suitable. notice: for deep sea fishing a line of 80 to 100lb test is recommended.    when the user is ready to pack up, he or she simply reels or winds the fishing line up and pushes down the arm member so that it folds against the mast. for even more compact storage, the indicator assembly can be removed. advantageously, no tools are required for assembly or disassembly.    for more information go to   fishing

not a lonely planet earth is definitely not a lonely planet, i shot  this video in late april 2010 and all the sounds were recorded at the time of shooting. there is the sound of birds, many of them migratory which have recently arrived for nesting, the sound of kids and parents along with the constant noise of city life. definitely not lonely.      but we are on the way to making our planet not only lonely but very quiet with the constant and accelerated destruction of habitat and species. the oil spill in the gulf is just the latest but by no means the only act of destruction that we are thrusting on the planet. in central america there are canadian companies mining for gold, but before they could access the gold the local residents had to be forcibly evicted. some were killed by the military. mining today is not about a small hole in the ground. the entire mountain is laid waste and the inherent pollution is harming the people living in the area. coal mining in the usa accomplishes the same results and in alberta it's the tar sands.    we slaughter seals in canada for the fashion industry, but europe has barred the importation of seal products so the canadian government (not representing the majority view) will take the european union too court. in alaska they shoot wolves from airplanes so hunters will have more trophy game like moose and caribou to kill.  japan slaughters dolphins in the cove by the tens of thousands, kills whales for research and in the open seas sharks are being killed to extinction for their fins. in africa bush meat or wild game is not only hard to find due to poaching but most of the animals have parasites harmful to the people who eat them.    its a nasty little world we have created in the name of progress, and this is just the tip of the iceberg which we also won't have for long due to global warming.    does anybody care? planet earth nature wetlands park marsh ponds beavers muskrat otters pheasants nesting birding birds ducks fish beaver pheasant red wing blackbird migratory bird watching wetlands protections management restoration programs freshwater oil spill habitat conservation destruction endangered environmentalists kelowna british columbia destination canada jcv yolo jcvdude hd travel videos videographer okanagan carp hellobc bctourism ng tours optics binoculars holidays trips vacation packages

tri-creeks experimental watershed study george sterling summarizes 30 years of research at the tri-creeks experimental watershed in west-central alberta, south of hinton, alberta. thirty years ago logging was done quite differently in alberta. specifically, the experimental watershed study looked at clear cutting and logging along riparian areas using paired watersheds monitored from 1965 to 1987.   after road construction and logging, in spite of limited data and quality control issues, some interpretation of fish survival and water quality could be made. some limited monitoring in the 1990's and then in the 2000's completed the monitoring. george points to temperature modeling in streams and flow increases during incubation as techniques for the future. he also identifies encroachment by non-native species (brook trout) as a forestry management issue.   george sterling is senior fisheries biologist with alberta environment and sustainable resource development, at edson, alberta. his presentation was part of the 2013 fri water program workshop. alberta hinton fish george sterling clear cut logging riparian zone

deepwater cisco stocking off the usgs research vessel kaho   the usgs tunison lab of aquatic science (cortland, ny) and the usgs lake ontario biological station (oswego, ny), which are both part of the usgs great lakes science center, collaborated each year from 2012-2014 in the release of deepwater cisco ("bloater") off of the usgs research vessel kaho in the lake ontario waters off of oswego, new york, in late fall. last observed in the wild in the mid-1980s, bloater was a critical native component to the lake ontario deepwater fish community, providing healthy prey fish to lake trout and integrating energy transfer from the lake's deep waters to its surface. this stocking is part of an effort to restore the species to lake ontario. the project is funded by the great lakes restoration initiative. this video clip is a five-minute underwater filming of the event. usgs science fish stocking field work research vessel usgs great lakes science center restoration ecology oswego new york great lakes lake ontario great lakes restoration initiative glri deepwater cisco bloater fish preyfish

fraser river sockeye and sea lice : response by marine harvest   a video produced by raincoast research in 2008 attempted to link sea lice infections on sockeye salmon with salmon farms. unfortunately, this video lacks scientific objectivity and contains many errors and omissions.  some of these errors and omissions are:  1. sea lice are a natural ocurring parasite hosted by many wild fish in the ocean throughout the year. 2. all salmon farms in british columbia are highly regulated and adhere to strict sea lice management protocols. 3. during the filming, wild pacific herring were present and hosting millions of sea lice - specifically the 'caligus' species.  4. the main species identified on the juvenile sockeye in the video are 'caligus', the same species found on the wild pacific herring present at the time of the sample. 5. the main species of sea lice typically identified on farmed salmon is 'lepeophtheirus salmonis' - a different species than is on the juvenile sockeye. 6. salmon farms near the sample area were hosting less than .01 sea lice per farmed salmon at the time the video was taken. there were zero egg bearing female lice at the time the video was shot. 7. the juvenile sockeye in this video may not actually be from the fraser river, as they are too small. 8. no mortality (due to sea lice) of juvenile salmon have been recorded with this size of fish (larger than 1 gram). 9. this same environmental group (raincoast research)was invited to salmon farms to witness sea lice monitoring samples during the spring of 2008. they attended two separate samples at two different farms, but refused to witness the counts (zero sea lice were found on 120 farmed salmon that were sampled).  the following video highlights a sea lice sample taken during the same time period at a farm site next to the sampling area chosen by raincoast research. (3:38)  2011 update - the 2010 return of fraser river sockeye was the highest return in over 100 years (30 million +). the 2010 adults were juveniles in 2008 - the same juveniles rumoured to be "at risk" from salmon farms by raincoast research and others.     to learn more about sea lice and fish health management at marine harvest canada visit  fraser river sockeye wild salmon farmed fish aquaculture b.c. british columbia twyla roscovich alexandra morton sea lice

bald eagles & salmon spawning it's salmon spawning season in british columbia's beautiful lower mainland, which means that bald eagles are sure to follow.    this video was shot right here where we live and at weaver creek spawning channel just down the street, as well as at the nearby inch creek fish hatchery, where coho salmon are raised.    the instincts of pinks, chum and sockeye salmon drive them to swim upstream to spawn, and they are everywhere around here this time of year.  we're right at the confluence of the harrison river and the chehalis river, just upstream from the fraser river, and all we have to do is stroll down to the waterfront at the end of the property to watch them spawn.    you can see that we're nestled into the beautiful bc coast mountains.  this time of year, the water level is so low that we can walk right out onto the flats, where the salmon are spawning in water that isn't even a foot deep.  if you watched our canoeing videos from earlier this year, when the water was up, you wouldn't even recognize the place now.    there are already dozens of eagles perched in the trees on the mountain across the street from us.  we've counted as many as 35 flying overhead at a time, and you can hear their distinctive call overhead all the time.    two weeks from now, the 16th annual fraser valley bald eagle festival begins.  our location is one of the prime spots for viewing eagles, which come from all over to get their fill of salmon. we're eagerly anticipating the arrival of hundreds, even thousands of bald eagles over the next couple of weeks.    for more about weaver creek spawning channel:      for more about inch creek fish hatchery:      for more about the fraser valley bald eagle festival:   salmon spawn spawning bald eagle coho sockeye chum pink fish ladder fraser valley river harrison hot springs chehalis bird

man uses drone to catch a large fish in a lake an incredible video has emerged from canada of a man using a drone to catch a large fish in a lake.  the footage, filmed on lake champlain near montreal on friday, shows youtuber viva frei challenging himself to catch a fish in a "real body of water" after seeing people using drones to catch fish in small ponds.  he later wrote online: "i had seen a couple of guys 'catching' fish with their drones, using worms on a hook in some small pond, but where is the challenge in that?   "so i decided to try and catch a fish the real way - by trolling a lure on a real body of water."  "i tied some fishing line to my drone, attached a jitterbug (a topwater lure), and set out to try and make internet history," he continued.  "truthfully, i did not expect anything to happen because i had tried a few times before, and just sputtered around until my battery went dead, but this time, on lake champlain, not only did i succeed, but i hooked the biggest smallmouth bass of my life.   "after i hooked it and managed to land it, i ran it to my wife for a quick photo op, and then ran it back to the water to release it.   "it swam off the enjoy the day, and i ran off and will spend the next ten years of my life talking about this - it was epic!"   subscribe for your daily dose of amazing videos!:   got a video to share? submit your video here:    like us on facebook:   follow us on twitter:    newsflare has an eager team of people searching the web for top video content to share, we also take submissions from those looking to make sure their videos get seen by many plus earn some money back. newsflare live and breath viral videos & awesome user generated content (ugc) and want to make sure you get the latest trends and hottest videos. subscribe now to see the best and newest!   this video is managed by newsflare. to use this video for broadcast or in a commercial player please email newsdesk@newsflare.com or call +44 (0) 8432 895 191   see the original video on newsflare:  water boat amazing drones fishing fish animals bass drone troll trolling boating lake champlain outrageous hook drone pike walleye perch uav unmanned aerial vehicle waters droning hooking awesoe missisquoi bay man uses drone to catch a large fish newsflare news videos news today journalism hard news worldwide latest news latest videos viral videos viral fail videos crashes stunts animal attack world record news flare

roe herring fishery opens march 6 th 2012 * lambert channel pacific coast canada ebb tide on a nearly full moon. presented in natural, commercial and industrial sound. the west coast herring spawn peaks in early march each year. mini documentary version.             learn about this fishery @ :     gill netters, herring skiffs, packers and support vessels gathered and strung out from the comox bar to henry point in baynes sound and ford cove in lambert channel deploying their gear in extremely favourable conditions under the auspices of the department of fisheries and oceans. this 11 minute video was shot over an 80 minute period at sundown from various locations on the eastern shore of denman island. for the most part, hornby island is the background.     "pacific herring (clupea pallasii) is a pelagic species which occurs in inshore and offshore waters of the north pacific. in the eastern pacific, herring are found from baja california to the beaufort sea in alaska.    herring mature and recruit to the spawning stock primarily between ages three and five. within this range, age-at-recruitment tends to increase with latitude. adult males and females migrate from the open ocean to sheltered bays around november or december, although in the far north of the range, these dates may be somewhat later.  conditions that trigger spawning are not altogether clear, but after spending weeks congregating in the deeper channels, both males and females will begin to enter shallower inter-tidal or sub-tidal waters. preferred spawning locations are sheltered bays and estuaries, commonly on eelgrass or other submerged vegetation. a single female may produce as many as 20,000 eggs in one spawn, however the juvenile survival rate is only about one resultant adult per ten thousand eggs, due to high predation by numerous other species."      { dfo } canada fishery lambert channel fishing new pacific roe spawn milt egg mass species seasonal harvest resource net drum beater marker scotchman buoy skiff fish commercial fishing herring clupea pallasii filongley tree island sandy komas bluffs phipps point salish sea pacific ocean boat bc ferry kahloke shingle spit denman east shoreline beach waterfall sunset gulls sea lions catch quota dfo eagle aquamarine ebbing tide full moon vancouver nature doc report

ice fisherman drowns in lenawee county christine long reports:  an ice fisherman drowns after falling into frigid water in lenawee county.  it happened thursday on timber lake in cambridge township, mi, which is northwest of adrian.  purple emt gloves and tire tracks from emergency vehicles are all that's left behind after thursday's tragic ice fishing outing.  the lenawee county sheriff says two men were ice fishing on timber lake. you can see the spot where they both fell through the ice.  investigators say just before noon someone called 9-1-1 after hearing two ice fishermen call for help. when crews arrived they pulled one man out of the water. that man, 52-year-old gerald lee smith from grass lake, survived after being lifelighted to toledo hospital. the second ice fisherman, 52-year-old michael james shoftsell from saline, died. shoftsell was found in 18 feet deep of water.  "it's very sad," says neal mahoney, a sylvania township trustee who has a place on nearby vineyard lake.  mahoney planned to ice fish over the weekend but will likely go back home.  "you've got to be out here with the right equipment and make sure that it's safe and right now it's not safe at all," says mahoney.  down at devil's lake ice fishermen are testing the thickness of the ice and setting up shanties close to shore.  rod skow has been fishing devil's lake in the winter for nearly three decades. he says the ice is tricky this year.  "this year we thought there'd be more ice than there is already but there's not," says skow. "certain areas there's only a couple inches right here, some areas where we are there's six inches."  fire officials all over lenawee county say even the most experienced ice fishermen need to remember that no ice is safe ice.  "make sure that there's, in my opinion, four inches of ice or more which goes again the grain of the old timers," says addison fire chief tim shaw. "personally i wouldn't step on the ice unless there's eight to ten inches." ice safety fisherman drowning lenawee county michigan fishing fish shanty

48" niagara river musky bites man and is released. man needs 9 stitches. musky fishing can be dangerous. remember to always wear a glove when handling these fish!     i got on the water at 6:20am and on my first drift hooked and landed (by myself) the biggest musky i've ever caught (48").     with muskies they die so easily you can't take them out of the water for a long time. so musky fishermen have really big nets where you can tie it to the side of the boat and leave the musky in the water swimming around in the giant "live well" net while you get your camera ready for a pic.     i had this one in the net, got my camera ready for a picture and stuck my hand in the water by her head to grab under her gill plate when the fish turned opened her mouth and slashed my hand wide open. as i was bleeding, looking at the muscle in my hand, i knew i had to go to the er but wanted a pic badly. so i hockey taped up my hand, took her out of the water, took a pic then released the fish. i then had to load my boat back up by myself, get to the er and get 9 stitches!    i was off the water in 30 minutes. still, i think it was worth the trouble. i should have been wearing my protective glove! video of the release, stitches and fish is in this clip. musky fish muskie new york niagara river buffalo ny fishing man catch and release freshwater fishing blood stitches bite bitten cut

ice fishing on lake of the woods, mn minnesota's woodland-and-lake wilderness is the northwest angle. the northernmost point of the continental u.s., it is 150 miles closer to the north pole than the upper tip of maine. when conditions are right, you can even see the northern lights.  right now, resorts are closing at the end of their "warm" season. (when i arrived a week ago, it was 34 degrees and snowing!) owners and operators scatter for quick tropical vacations before "ice in," when temperatures plummet to negative ranges, freezing the 1,679-square mile lake of the woods into a solid mass of ice slightly bigger than rhode island.  soon, the "ice road" will emerge as a highway for snowmobiles and bombardiers. resorts fill up again with winter sports enthusiasts. and the frozen lake becomes prime real estate for ice #fishing.  listen as joe henry with #lakeofthewoodsmn talks about "buckshot rattle spoons," "dead sticks" and "sleeper fish houses."

centuries of fish, seattle's dynamic distant water fishing fleet during the latter half of the 19th century, square-rigged sailing ships propelled by the wind and the strength of men's arms left the seattle waterfront, bound for the alaska fishing grounds. at the dawn of the 21st century, factory ships armed with technology worthy of the starship enterprise leave the seattle waterfront, bound for fishing grounds throughout the north pacific. for well over 100 years, this northwest city has been arguably the world's greatest fishing port and the hub of an industry that has played a surprisingly important role in shaping the culture and economy of the pacific northwest region.  centuries of fish is a documentary videotape that tells the story of an industry that operates largely out of sight and out of the minds of those engaged in shoreside pursuits. for those who know the sea, however, this industry, the last enterprise in the modern world in which men and women hunt a product in the wild, is an enduring source of sustenance and fascination.
