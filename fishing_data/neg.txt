Up in the mountains of British Columbia there are many lakes and lodges catering to campers and fishermen.  Predominantly the fish of choice is the rainbow or Kamloops trout, colorful and good eating, they are relatively easy to catch. Fly fishing, trolling or just fishing with bait like worms can be productive.  This video was filmed at Beaver Lake which is about 20 km from Kelowna.  WARNING!!!

Ice Fishing On Lake Erie! Or Not!http://www.mikehurl.com - Ice Fishing On Lake Erie. This was our second fishing trip of the year without much luck at all! No one in the entire bay reported catching anything. The only thing we did see were mud puppies on the bottom and some actually surfaced through the wholes in the ice.So if your looking for Ice Fishing On Lake Erie. Grangers ICe Fishing out of St Williams Ontario is a good outfitter.  So from what the guide told me is the best Ice Fishing On Lake Erie is the first few weeks the ice is in or the last week before the huts come off. So book your Ice Fishing On Lake Erie trip around those dates for better fishing.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2C2HqgAS6U

Homemade boat loaderHere is my home made boat loader system. In this video I show it operating (both loading & unloading)  I created this system because my boat, a Lund WC12, weighs in at 205 pounds.  Much too heavy for me to heave up on a truck rack by myself.  I used an ATV winch welded to some square tube steel into my front receiver hitch.  This allows me go camping with my toys!  I also carry my dirt bike on the front of the truck on a motorcycle carrier.   I created this because the fully automatic boat loaders cost $3000 or more and my system came in just over $500.    You may view another video of the details of the boat loader system by clicking on the link at the end of  the video or here - https://youtu.be/ZlPfe5LmqLI

The ONE and ONLY Model Ship Bluenose II (2006) on YouTubeThis is my second Bluenose model (I used the first, a smaller-scale Bluenose I, as a sort of "trial run"), completed in early 2006. The kit, by Bateaux Leclerc, reproduces the original Bluenose II ship (1963), which differs from the contemporary ship we know today. My current project is another Bluenose II model on the same scale, but in the more contemporary version (see my video "At the Helm of Bluenose II in 2006"). I expect to complete it sometime in 2009. Oups... make that 2010! -------------------------------------------- Après un rodage effectué avec un petit modèle du Bluenose I, j'ai complété ce Bluenose II au début de 2006. Le kit, signé Bateaux Leclerc, reproduit le navire original de 1963, qui diffère du voilier que nous connaissons aujourd'hui. Mon projet actuel, que je compte achever en 2010, est un autre modèle du Bluenose II selon la même échelle, mais qui reproduira le navire dans sa version contemporaine (voir ma vidéo intitulée «At the Helm of Bluenose II in 2006»).

What Romppai's & Romppai's U-Haul dealer Center sells and services we offerWe get asked all the time, what all do you sell, what all services do you offer, well the short and long of it is, 29 years ago I started off as a fishing tackle MFG, then went into a wholesale distributor, well today. we not only wholesale many product lines including our own name brand fishing tackle, in 2013 I moved my shop from Laukka Laine, of Auto Road in Kaministiquia Ont. to the City of Thunder Bay, On. in Current River on Arundel street. in the past year I have moved this great adventure 2 times in order to fit the needs of our customers, we are now located at 355 N Cumberland Street Thunder Bay, On. P7A4P4. in the late 1970's Currant River lost its only hardware store, so to fill that huge gap I started stocking many hardware product, electrical products in both DC and AC, plumbing, computers, electronics, Marine parts for all makes and models of I/O and outboards from Sierra and many other marine brands, as well as marine repairs, small engine repairs, we sell and install trailer hitch's, 5th Wheel Hitch's, trailer repairs, automotive oil changes, servicing and minor repairs, the list keeps going, right into U-Haul rentals, U-Haul used truck sales, U-Haul U-box storage  and so much more, so to better cover all this and much more, I thought I would do many live video's to show off all our products, service, so you the end consumer can get a much deeper insight to everything we have to offer you. This is a huge under taking, and can not be all covered in one or 2 videos, so this will  be a series of live video's to come

This is aerial video of some of the family cabin at Salmonier Pond on the Burin Peninsula in Newfoundland and Labrador Canada. The "Pond" is know for it's beautiful location nestled into a valley in the rolling rocky bluffs. This is a favorite spot for anglers and has some very nice trout and is a salmon spawning area.  The pond is especially beautiful in the early morning, when the water is like a mirror, but is beautiful any time of day or year.

Fish Grilling Tips and Recipe - Marinade and BBQ (Tautog Recipe)Welcome to today's fish cooking episode of Thundermist Fishing Tips. Today we're going to be BBQ'ing some delicious tautogs.  Check out the catching Tautog video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5gexGEOO9o  Antonio, the boatless angler himself, shares with us his recipe. He makes a quick and easy marinade which only needs to rest with the fish for about two hours before cooking.  The big issue when it comes to BBQ'ing fish is that the fillet tends to stick to the grill. The secret to that is to simply leave the skin and scales on. If you descale it, the skin still tends to get stuck to the grill. The best way to prevent your tautog fillet from sticking to the BBQ is to leave the scales on. This applies to other fish as well! There are other methods of course, like tin-foil, or other purchasable ways, but we find that simply leaving the skin and scales on is the simplest method when it comes to barbecuing fish.  For this marinade, it's simple and you don't need to be precise. First you start with a generous amount of olive oil in a plastic bag. Add one full lemon, squeezed, pits and all. We also added some paprika, simple onion powder (just some, you don't want to over do this part), garlic powder (again, just a bit to taste. You can overdo this as well). Mix them all right into the bag along with a bit of black pepper. And that's it!  Next add all the fillets into the bag, the fillets with the skin and scales. Close the bag, and mix them all together. Take out any additional air from the bag, re-seal, and let it rest in the fridge.  The longer you let the fish marinade, the better. But for today we only let the tautog marinade for 2 hours. Overnight in the fridge is a great suggestion as well.  The grill is preheated to 400 degrees F. We want to char the bottom of the fillet along the skin and scales. There's no need to flip the fish, and the whole cooking process usually takes about 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish with the lid closed.  Don't forget to pour the extra marinade over the fish to get all the flavour.  We did not add salt to the marinade, the best way is to salt the fish while it is on the grill, or even on the table when about to be severed.  You can tell when the fillets are ready as the fillets will start to crack and flake apart. Taking the fish off of the grid should be much easier now with the skin and scales on.  This recipe works not only on Tautog, but on any non-frozen fish as well!

Mountain That Fell On A Town. Oct- 2015 Frank slide.The Frank Slide was a rockslide that buried part of the mining town of Frank, Northwest Territories,[nb 1] Canada, on the morning of April 29, 1903. It occurred at 4:10 am, when over 82 million tonnes (90 million tons) of limestone rock slid down Turtle Mountain within 100 seconds, obliterating the eastern edge of Frank, the Canadian Pacific Railway line and the coal mine. It was one of the largest landslides in Canadian history and remains the deadliest, as between 70 and 90 of the town's residents were killed, most of whom remain buried in the rubble.    For those that are thinking this is in Alberta, you are of course correct,  but in 1903 it was still considered The North West Territories until it was changed  and we officially became the Province of Alberta in 1905.

How to Cook Mackerel and Bluefish - Easy with No Fishy TasteWe are back in the kitchen again, and do I ever have a recipe for you!  This recipe is for any fish that tastes overly fishy. for example mackerel or bluefish. This recipe takes all the fishiness out of the fish while leaving you with an amazing dish!  It's easy to do, as with all our recipes, and it takes basic ingredients which you most likely already have in your kitchen. Here's what it takes:  Ingredients - 3 TBS olive oil - diced tomatoes - chili pepper - oregano - salt and pepper - 2 onions, thinly sliced - 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced  And that's it!  First you'll want to slice up your two onions and your two cloves of garlic. I like to slice them very thin, as they tend to cook up nicer this way. That's it for the prep!  Next you'll want to take your three tablespoons of olive oil and add it to your pan. Add the onion and garlic to the pan and lightly fry the onions and garlic for about 2-3 minutes. This way the olive oil can absorb the flavour from the onion and garlic.  Next, take your diced tomatoes and pour them into the pan with the already cooking oil, onions, and garlic mixture. This is where you'll want to add your salt, pepper, and oregano. Basically what you're doing is seasoning your tomatoes.  You'll want to use about a teaspoon of salt and as much black pepper and oregano to taste. If you want, you can add chili pepper to the mix. I like to add that bit of heat.  Now with this mix, we're going to stir everything together and let it simmer over medium to medium high, for about 10 to 15 minutes, just enough to make sure everything is all cooked together.  After the 10/15 minutes, you can add any type of fish you'd like. I suggest using a fish that is stronger or fishy tasting like mackerel or bluefish. You'll be amazed how great they taste! Cut your fish fillets into halves and add them to the mix. You can add them whole if you'd like. This works well with whole fillets, half fillets, or even a whole mackerel!  Make sure you mix the fish up with the tomatoes and get everything all simmering together. Cook the fish for about 10 to 15 minutes depending how high you have the heat. You'll want to keep them simmering.  You'll know when the mackerel or bluefish is done, when the fish fillets starts to break apart a bit.  The last step, is to enjoy!

Ascend D10T -2016 Fall first TestI wanted to get a video up long ago, this is our first on water test of our new fishing yaks. I purchased the Ascend D10T kayak from Bass Pro in Alberta for $499 new, Its 10" long & 34" wide, it's very stable with an awesome fishing platform. Bishopp added a beach chair to improve comfort. :)  Bishopp "Tha Prophet" purchased the new Pelican Catch 120 for $900 new in Sask, it's 11' 8" long & 34" wide, it features a 2 position adjustable seat with a great fishing platform as well. Both are a great budget kayak that are extremely stable, honestly they can compete with the larger price tag yaks.

Sask Yak Fishing - Pelican Catch 120 finally  hits the waterFinally after a long wait, it's time to test our new Kayaks With our tight budget we did great! I purchased the Pelican Catch 120 from Canadian Tire, it's 11' 8" long and 34" wide, I'm 6' 2" and a  big guy and this yak has room to spare as well as it sits high on the way and remains extremely stable. LOVE IT!!!!  Venus "Sask Angler" Purchased the Ascend D10T from Bass Pro in Alberta, it's 10' Long & 34" wide, she's mid 5' and has tons of room left, it's extremely stable as well.  Both yaks are perfect fishing vessels, crazy stable, agile and fairly quick for their width.  Verdict: The Catch 120 is the best pelican yak I have ever used, I'm very impressed with it's quality, performance and layout. As for the Ascend D10T, this kayak is also very impressive for quality, performance and space for a 10' yak, it should have been bass pro's first 10' sit on fishing yak. If you're on a tight budget consider either of these 2 yaks, you won't be disappointed. Keep your rod bent and lines tight!!!

Unlucky Duck in Sault, OntarioA poor duck near the marina in St. Mary's River, in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, with a fishing lure caught in its foot. The hook seems to be through the web of the left foot. The duck was dragging that foot a bit, but it didn't seem to trouble it too much in the water. Probably a different story on land, though... The date was Saturday, July 24, 2010.

Grizzly Bear Tours and other activities: Tweedsmuir Park Lodge, Bella Coola, BC, Canada 2010Our 2010 summer promotional video showcasing our heli hiking, heli fishing and grizzly bear tours and adventures. We are proud as of 2011 our Grizzly Bear Tours and Grizzly bear Viewing has been recognized by the Canadian Tourism Commission and included in their prestigious "Signature Experiences Collection" which highlights once-in-a-lifetime authentic Canadian experiences!  The historic Tweedsmuir Park Lodge, set on 60 acres of private land within the vast wilderness of British Columbia's largest protected park, is the ideal setting for your wilderness adventures and experiences. Originally built in 1929 as a hunting and fishing lodge, today the lodge accommodates those seeking out a more eco-friendly adventure as well as a relaxing refuge from the pressures of modern life.  The surrounding environment is stunning. Rising above the valley floor are the majestic Coast Mountains, to the west is the largest fjord system in the Americas, and to the east the high Chilcotin Plateau. It is a bio-diverse and spectacular wilderness, home to the totemic wildlife of the Great Bear Rainforest.  Our lodge borders the Atnarko River and in the fall the Grizzly Bears come down to feast on the spawning Salmon. We are smack in the middle of what is one of the healthiest bear habitats in the world and often the bears can be seen wandering past the lodge. Sometimes we even catch them napping on the lawn.  All accommodation at the Tweedsmuir Park Lodge is in one of ten private chalets with the main lodge providing lots of common space for dining, games, and socializing. It is perfect set up for family reunions and corporate groups, which can book the full premises, yet intimate enough that the individual traveler and smaller groups will feel at home. The focus throughout is on great service, and an authentic, welcoming Canadian hospitality.  Although the lodge and the entire Bella Coola Valley are geographically remote, it is nevertheless easy and convenient to make your way to our door step.  At Tweedsmuir Park Lodge we are lucky to live in a stunning and pristine environment and have a wonderful community supporting us. We are committed to keeping it that way and ask all our guests to participate in our environmental stewardship initiatives to ensure that Bella Coola continues to be the most extraordinary place in the world to enjoy the great outdoors.  Join us. Your expectations will be surpassed!!

Grey wolf swimming to shoreline-  Ontario Canada -We were on a fly in fishing trip to Abamasagi lake ontario when the unexpected happened.  I have read about this from the thickest books and have only seen 1 photo in a friends cabin, it is rarer sight then a Minnesota Vikings winning super bowl trophy, I know that is rare being from Minnesota.    If my father and I had not fished this point the night before the walleye would have been so thick that this would not have been possible.    A swimming grey wolf...  #do not get me too close.  #Awesome Possum, Holy Cow.  Thanks for viewing.  Dustin Petersen & Brian Brackenbury

Episode 31 - Float Tube Phoenix on Mike LakeMike Lake in Golden Ears Provincial Park is a fantastic close to home lake.  Mike Lake is stocked with Fraser Valley Hatchery Rainbow Trout several times a year.  These are your typical triploid clones, easy to catch and not very thrilling to land.

Kayaking in the Great Bear Rainforest in October3 ATBO students from College of the Rockies, Golden start a kayaking trip in Bella Bella and end in Prince Rupert. This Journey took them 26 days of paddling through the Great Bear Rainforest of British Columbia. Home to the spirit bear, grizzly bear, black bear, wolves, humpback whales, orcas, dolphins, seals, sea otters, river otters, and lots more. It is truly the Amazon of the North. What is so terrible is Canada has a projected plan to ship oil through this waters via 1000 foot oil takers through less than 2 km wide channels. Up in these waters are some of the biggest tides on the Pacific Coast and it would be complete and utterly chaotic. SAY NO TO ENBRIDGE!!!! ENJOY.

The lot also sits on a hill which grants the new owner some amazing 360 degree panoramic views of the ocean, beaches, and the surrounding rolling hills.

1000 Islands 360_Aerial of Rock Island Lighthouse SunsetRock Island Lighthouse is located in the Thousand Islands about 4.5 miles northeast of Clayton, Jefferson County, New York, off of Fisher's Landing. Originally commissioned in 1847, it is one of six lights put up along the St. Lawrence River to guide traffic to and from Lake Ontario through the waterway. The Rock Island station is the best preserved, as all of its structures still survive. It was refitted in 1855, rebuilt in 1882, and moved in 1903. The light was closed in 1955 after more a century of service.  In June 2013, the island and all its buildings were  reopened to the public as a park maintained by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation & Historic Preservation.  The island is accessible by private boat and local shuttle service, and the grounds are open for touring and picnicking. www.rockislandlighthouse.org questions? riverjeffry@gmail.com jeffweldon.com

Denbigh 1967 Centennial Celebrations by Bill ScottThis early 8mm film was discovered in the basement of the Denbigh Community Hall around 2001 during some 'spring cleaning'. It was digitized and used as a fund raiser for the Addington Highlands Public Libraries.  The video was filmed by Mr. Bill Scott (now deceased) - owner of Scott's Shopping Centre at the base of Eagle Hill (Ashby Lake Road).  Bill had the foresight to video record many community activities during the 1967 Centennial year in Denbigh.  The entire film is 31 minutes long and starts with the New Year's Eve Dance followed by the Ski-doo Races on Denbigh Lake displayed above with the dance afterwards.

Temagami Ontario Canada flv   YouTubeTemagami is the reality that fuels the popular perception of Canada's great North land, with old growth pine forests; smooth blue waters; brilliantly white, powdery snow; and bountiful fish and wildlife.  Temagami is steeped in history. Some of the world's oldest rock has surfaced here, and has been scraped and smoothed by centuries of glaciation. Artifacts and stone drawings dating as far back 6000 B.C. have been discovered here. Grey Owl, the mysterious naturalist who captured the world's imagination back in the 1930s, has become a part of the Temagami landscape. Over the centuries, people have been drawn to the area as if by a magnet. Temagami is truly a place of mystical magic, an adventurer's mecca.  Temagami has been a renowned centre for outdoor and wilderness recreation for over 100 years.

Nine Lakes, Haliburton County, Ontario, CANADALocated in Haliburton County, just 2 1/2 hours north of Toronto, Nine Lakes is a pristine reserve of just under 7000 acres of forest, lakes and rivers. Divided into nine parcels, each with its own lake, this rugged, unspoiled wilderness awaits your adventurous spirit. First explored by pioneer loggers pushing up from the Ottawa valley in the early 1800’s much of the Haliburton area is now protected and preserved as a wildlife sanctuary.   A mix of coniferous trees, maple forests and spruce bogs, Nine Lakes is alive with white tail deer, black bear, beaver, wolves, moose and dazzling mix of bird species including Indigo Buntings, Boreal Chickadees, Grey Jays and Spruce Grouse. The rivers and lakes teem with Trout, Muskie, Walleye and Northern Pike providing outstanding fishing.  Nine Lakes, whether it’s a corporate retreat in a private piece of Canadian Wilderness at its very best, a quiet long term family investment with that idyllic lakeside home you’re always dreamed of, or as a whole parcel with significant development potential, the Nine Lakes adventure awaits your touch.

Scuba Kahnawake 2011Scuba movie filmed with my new camera Sony DSC-HX9V with an Ikelite undewater case also a Bonica dive led light G8V15 and a wide angle conversion dome WD-4.  This movie have been filmed at the beautiful Kahnawake quarry near Montreal QC Canada in september 2011. I think that this setup performed amazingly! the only drawback that i found is the battery life compare to my old Canon SD780-IS.   Note : The vigneting in the corners is only due because i did not place the wide angle len sun shield as it sould be, i fixed the problem at the end of the movie as you can see.

Massassauga Provincial Park - Portage to Little Blackstone LakeThe portage to Little Blackstone Lake from Pete's Place Access Point...in a nutshell. It can take anywhere from 2 hours to 5 hours, depending on conditions. Sam and I went from July 19th to July 21st. The black flies were annoying but if you're an experienced backcountry camper, you know how to handle them. I didn't catch a single fish during this trip - the stunning views and experience made up for that...I guess.

Presque Isle State Park - Full Drive ThroughIf you are thinking about taking a trip to Presque Isle State Park, or want to remember what it looks like from a past visit, this is a video of what it looks like to drive around the park.  There is a main loop that first goes along the shore of Presque Isle Bay, turns around near the tip of the peninsula, and then travels along the shore facing Lake Erie.  Although there are several places that were not explored, this is a drive on the main road with two popular side-roads (near the beaches facing Lake Erie).  If you like the video or found it useful, don't forget to give it a thumbs up.

Wood River Expedition Episode 1: Sunwapta Falls to Athabasca CrossingThe plan was to accomplish the first descent of the remote Wood River in British Columbia by hiking into 24km from Sunwapta Falls into it's headwaters at Fortress Lake, paddling 15km across the lake, 30 km down the river (excluding 2 major class VI waterfall filled canyons) then ascending back up 3500 ft in 37 km to the continental divide though Athabasca pass, crossing into Alberta again and navigating the Whirlpool River the remaining 80 km back to the Icefield Parkway.   Turns out there is a reason no one has ever done this before. Luke Schmidt punctured his raft, we did some canyon swimming,ended up losing both boats (and my paddle) in a gorge. This necessitated some severe bushwhacking and spending some chilly nights on the mountainside, but in the end we completed this 5 day trip in a mere 11 days :).   In this episode we eat wild strawberries, do some hiking, get wet, try out my new Ultralight Tipi Tent by Seek Outside (the BT-2) and do some fishing in the most beautiful little lake you'll ever see.

Conversations That Matter Episode 18 Jim McIsaacEpisode 18 Jim McIsaac BC Commercial Fishing Caucus  This week’s Conversation that Matters features Jim McIsaac of the BC Commercial Fishing Caucus.  McIsaac says, since the restructuring of the commercial fishing industry in the 90’s communities up and down the coast have been disenfranchised from the sector that was their lifeblood. He says, it comes at a time when fish stocks are well managed and robust. McIsaac points out fishing is a fraction of its former size.

Did The YAMAHA ATV's Grizzly And Kodiak See A Nessie At Ingall Falls? lol - Oct.20 2012Today's adventure takes us out exploring down the Dore Lake - Ingall Falls area. Was a pretty nice day out for this time of year! We come across some "Nessie" type creature swimming around in the lake below Ingall Falls. Pretty sure it was an Otter, but who am I to say? hahaha Quite a beautiful area down there. Lots of camping spots and lakes, creeks, rivers, water-falls, you name it! We are pretty lucky to have such a great area to ride! Buckle up you helmet and enjoy the ride!  If you like our videos, be sure to comment, share, thumbs up and subscribe!

ATV Rain Ride! The Grizzly 700 Is Back On Zilla's - Wheelie? - May 18 2013Cubbeezx is about Cubbee and CK's  everyday real life ATV Moto Vlogging X'LeNt Adventures.  Our regular quad rides are a 2011 Yamaha Grizzly 700 EPS and a 2011 Yamaha Kodiak 450 SE EPS.  On weekends, we usually can be found exploring the back woods of North Western Ontario on wheels or tracks.  First ride of the season without the tracks on the Yamaha Grizzly 700! Unfortunately, it poured rain the whole weekend. We weren't going to let that stop us. Cubbee had not done a wheelie in like 8 or 9 months and was starting to have withdrawals! lol Did the Gilbert Lake loop trail, it was awesome. A herd of black bears ran across the trail in front of us. At first we thought there were three big ones, but I think there may have been four!! On the way home we came across the smallest baby deer we have ever seen. It was trying to cross the highway with it's mom. We waited for it and it turned around and hit in the ditch, so we managed to get a quick picture of it.    If you like our videos, be sure to comment, share, thumbs up and subscribe!

Burr Lake ATV Ride Via The Beaver Dam Trail - July 14 2013Out for a Sunday quad ride on the Yamaha 700 Grizzly and Kodiak 450 atv's to Burr Lake. I think it was about a year or two ago we had gone through this trail. Lots of beaver dams to cross, but nothing too bad. Not sure why, but the water levels in Burr Lake were down about 3 feet. Maybe a beaver dam let go down stream or something?  If you like our videos, be sure to comment, share, thumbs up and subscribe!

Geocaching in NipigonEvery Labour Day weekend, a pair of geocachers from Nipigon organize a cache hunt to coincide with the Nipigon Fall Fishing Festival. Geocachers from all over North Western Ontario descend upon the community for caching and fun.  This year, we went again, and I took my two year old son for a hike up to The Bald Spot to find a couple geocaches. I wasn't quite sure what to expect for the trail up there, or the difficulty of the climb. The trail and geocache were very nice, but I was mostly impressed by my son who did the hike all by himself.  It was a beautiful fall morning, the leaves were just starting to change colour, and it smelled wonderful. We had a great hike and geocache hunt, and I wanted to save the memory with this video.

The lighter side of Dogskin Lake LodgeWe're pretty serious about our fishing, but when you're on an island for 4 months, you've got to have a little fun.  Here's some quick clips of a few great guests from Illinois and Arizona, as well as our staff from the past couple of days.  FYI, the guitar playing was at 10:30pm...
Music Video #1 (Sweet Potato Fly)The first in a series of videos for my original music, this song seemed like an appropriate starting point.  I used images and video clips from my last family fishing trip to Campbellford, Ontario, including beautiful landscapes and some great footage of my brother Mike catching a nice musky.  Using a slow zoom in/out on the still images made several of them appear as if the water is actually rippling.  My goal was to use simple editing techniques and processes to produce a dreamy atmosphere.

Automata FishingVideo of an automata project depicting a young boy fishing from a cottage dock on a warm summer day. He has his dog with him who excitedly looks into the water for fish. Two seagulls loiter nearby hoping to get some sort of tidbit. Under the dock lurks a largemouth bass, apparently uninterested in the bait. A catfish rests deep in the shadows and a crayfish moves in and out from his lair in some rocks. Unnoticed by the boy s little fish anxiously jumps at the bait just as the line is lifted and misses.

Carpe Lac Saint-Pierre Saison 2012.wmvVoici quelques moments de pêche de cette saison 2012 au Lac Saint Pierre, Québec, Canada. Une saison inoubliable...  Le lac Saint-Pierre constitue en réalité un élargissement du Saint Laurent. Il se divise en plusieurs bras à Sorel, découpant ainsi les îles du Lac. Ces différents bras se rejoignent alors pour former le lac, puis le fleuve reprend sa morphologie au niveau de Trois-rivières. Classé réserve mondiale de la biosphère, le lac Saint Pierre et ses îles affirment donc leur grande richesse : plus de 70 espèces de poissons, dont 8 sportives : carpe, esturgeon jaune, achigan petite et grande bouche (bass et black bass), dorés jaunes et noirs (sandres), maskinongé & brochet.   La Pourvoirie du Lac Saint Pierre se situe au coeur des îles, lui offrant un incroyable territoire de jeu, capable de ravir n'importe quel pêcheur : que vous soyez un inconditionnel du carnassier et des pêches actives ou bien désireux de piquer quelques belles communes vierges sur des spots sauvages lors de sessions mémorables, cette destination est faite pour vous...Osez l'aventure et affrontez le Saint Laurent!   Autres espèces présentes dans la video :  -achigans petite et grande bouche (bass) -dorés jaunes et noirs -maskinongé (1.30 m, 40 lbs) -brochet -poisson castor   Musique : The Glitch Mob - We can make the world stop

A Pair of Whale Tales from Vancouver Island Goes Viralhttp://www.ctvvancouverisland.ca http://www.facebook.com/ctvvi  Port Alberni - A pair of amazing fish tales are making the rounds on the west coast of Vancouver Island after two groups of anglers caught some breathtaking close encounters with whales.  Shirley Antonelli and her husband were fishing near the Broken Group Islands off the coast of Ucluelet on a two day trip on their Double Eagle boat when they got the scare of their life. A gray whale suddenly surfaced inches from the front of their boat, before swimming under the vessel and nearly sending the two anglers into the ocean.   The entire encounter was caught on tape.  Weeks earlier a fishing charter off the coast of Tofino got a first hand view of a humpback whale breaching. A client on board the boat caught the amazing mother nature show on tape and sent the company the footage.  Follow Chandler Grieve on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/CTVNewsChandler

Dip Net Fishing in Cape-BretonDip net fishing in a small pond off the Bras D'or lake in Cape-Breton Nova-Scotia. All fish were returned to the water alive, NONE were kept or harmed. - We spotted the small puddle full of Smelts from the road up a hill and ran down the hill with a dip net. There were probably 1000+ fish in the puddle and if we had a dip net with smaller holes you could have gotten a full net every swipe.

Motorboat Dem Rapids!+Pearl JamA few years ago the oldest son and I took a Pearl Jam + Fishing vacation.  We flew to Vancouver and enjoyed the city for a few days, then caught the Vancouver PJ show.  Next morning we flew to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, caught some puddle jumpers, ending-up in  La Ronge, Saskatchewan, 500 miles north of the Canadian border.  At La Ronge, the folks from "Angler Rapids" fishing lodge sent a float plane.  After a half hour flight up the Churchill River we came to Angler Rapids, a rustic yet comfortable lodge in a gorgeous wilderness setting.  September days at Angler Rapids are crisp & clear.  Nights with an autumn moon reflecting off the water and a sky full of stars are impossibly beautiful.  (In other seasons visitors get displays from Aurora Borealis).  But it's the waterway that is truly impressive.  The water here is always churning underneath your boat.  This fast, cold rushing current provides Angler Rapids with some of the best Walleye & Northern Pike fishing we've experienced.  After 3 days of FANTASTIC fishing, cooking our catch outdoors over open wood-fires, we had to make our way back home.  But it was OK, we caught Pearl Jam again, this time in Saskatoon, from the 2nd row, Stone's side of the stage.

It is a total of just over 19 minutes.  During some down time, reserve some time, get your refreshment of choice, get comfy and enjoy.  Thanks for watching.

Big Lake in Skagit CountyBig Lake is one of my more favorite lakes to visit, despite the fact that I have not personally had much luck there. But there are some big bass in this lake and a ton of nice habitat. The lake has a very good reputation for crappie, also.   The launch is rough and sandy in spots so bigger boats beware. Also, watch out for the winds which can get whipping up this long lake.   Check out the south end liily pads for some big bass!

Hiking Up To Garibaldi Lake, British Columbia (4K)Hiking Up To Garibaldi Lake, British Columbia. I took this trip in Late August of 2016 after I returned to Vancouver from Atlanta in the summer. Ive always wanted to hike up to Garibaldi Lake since my arrival to Vancouver last year. The amazing photos you see on instagram serve this lake no justice. it is 10X better in person.   However, the hype you get from Instagram isn't too good. I though I was going to be able to drive my car up most of the elevation and do a short hike up to get the views that I wanted. To get to Garibaldi lake, it is a 9-10km Hike, and its Steep!   Travel/Hike tips:  -Travel Light! -Bring Food -Wear Comfortable shoes  -Bring Bug Spray (depends time of year) -Take Breaks -Start early -Read the maps! know your surroundings   http://www.losfizz.com

King Fish Man  • In The Wild • TV Show Crowdfund TrailerThis is an overview video which describes the very unique talents of one Timmy Cudmore who humorously calls himself the "KING FISH MAN"! Timmy hails from the beautiful Prince Edward Island in Canada. He writes and sings songs about one of his greatest passions: TROUT FISHING! Yup, I said fishing.  '"In The Wild" is a TV Show idea inspired by the award-winning professor David Musial from America. It is part of the "NextGen Stars®" series in development which focuses on the "MENTOR' to the "Next Generation of Stars" in any field. Timmy teachers his children and grandchildren how to fish. He teaches us all through zany, musical humor, how fun it can be to fish.  Lot's of source footage has been shot in the past 3 years, including a great deal in the new "Ultra HD" format, so this Crowd Funding venture is designed to enable Professor Musial to employ a team of highly skilled, "directors-to-be", college interns, to assist him in producing a few more shoots & editing shows for potential network or social net distribution.  Timmy has many songs available for sales on iTunes, CD Baby ands more. Please consider supporting this cool mentorship venture by visiting KickStarter.com, and also...

Fraser Valley, BC - Harrison River CanoeingWe wanted to share how beautiful it is here in the Fraser Valley.  Our location directly on the Harrison River makes for easy canoe launching, and the water is still running high with snow melt, fed primarily from Harrison Lake and also from the Chehalis River.  Just downstream from us, the blue-green water of the Harrison runs into the mighty, and muddy, Fraser River.  This was shot right at the confluence of the Harrison & Chehalis Rivers. The air, water and mountains here are incredibly clean and beautiful.  If you listen closely, you can hear the birds singing.

Yellowknife NT - Aerial view of Cameron FallsTaken July 18 2015. Watch in HD for better viewing.          Cameron Falls  is located within Hidden Lake Territorial Park, on the Ingraham Trail. It is approximately 47 km east of Yellowknife.       There is a small parking lot with pit toilet facilities, at the start of a 20 minute hike along a well marked trail to Cameron Falls. The falls are worth a visit at all times of the year. In winter the falls are frozen right over. In spring, melt-waters roar under the ice. Water levels in summer have been known to drop low enough to allow walking across the falls above the overhang. And in the fall the changing colours of the leaves are always a good reason to bring along your camera.  ATTRACTIONS & POINTS OF INTEREST:      It is possible to hike upstream from Cameron Falls to the Cameron River Ramparts Waterfalls, a distance of 8 or 9 km. The trail is not well developed, but the river is relatively easy to follow and the route is obvious. If you choose to follow the north (far) side of the river, there is a foot bridge at Cameron Falls, which also offers access into the rest of Hidden Lake Park. You will have to re-cross the river at the Ingraham Trail bridge at Cameron River Crossing, a short ways upstream from the Ramparts.       The park offers access for canoeists to the Lower Cameron River Canoe Route, one of the Ingraham Trail Canoe Routes.- www.NWTParks.ca  Tags: Aerial Photography Northwest Territories Canada Drone UAV Waterfalls Canada Yellowknife DJI Phantom 3 2 1 GoPro Camera awesome spectacular scenic view mountains landscape

Blane Chocklett's T-Bone Musky FlyBlane Chocklett swings by SO World Headquarters and cooks up his T-Bone musky fly. The T-Bone has a huge profile and a great "kick" that make it perfect for big ambush predators like Musky. More importantly, Blane demonstrates the use of articulated shanks and flex tubing, both of which are really pushing the boundaries of what's possible in fly design. Great stuff Blane!  Looking for hard to find materials to tie Blane's T-Bone? Give Schultz Outfitters a call (734-544-1761). If you're ever in the Ypsilanti, MI area be sure to stop by and check out our original Bar Flies tying event. Always the first. Still the best.

Why does Alberta allow this illegal practice to continue?As we paddled across the province of Alberta on the North Saskatchewan river we were appalled to see so many cows pooping on shore.  This is an illegal practice and yet despite the fact that these farmers have beautiful large homes, great big shiny farm equipment they are allowed to cut corners and pollute our waters.  All this water flows downstream.  The fish population is stressed and the water is so polluted it's disgusting.  Our actions affect others - how these farmers can sleep at night I don't know.  I think it's a shame that some people care more about money than the environment.  I think it's ridiculous that the Albertan authorities allow this continue.  What do you think? We are all stewards of this land - we must all do our part.

Capilano River Coho Salmon Indian Reserve Massacre North Vancouver British ColumbiaCapilano Coho Salmon Indian Reserve Massacre in North Vancouver British Columbia September 2012. Not saying anything "illegal" was done here. But sometimes you should not do stuff "just because you can, legally speaking". Oh and read this on Wiki about the Indian Band "The Capilano Reserve is the site of major commercial and residential developments, mostly on the West Vancouver side of its area. These include the Park Royal Shopping Centre and associated apartment buildings, and a small office tower adjacent to the intersection of Taylor Way, and a large recreational vehicle park more or less beneath the northern end of the Lions Gate Bridge (the highway interchange for the bridge is also on reserve land). Foreshore properties along Vancouver Harbour leased from reserve lands include bulk terminals and other port facilities. Revenues from all these arrangements are part of band finances." http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X%CC%B1wemelch'stn You may want to download this video in case it gets removed again.

⇢ MYSTERY UNBOXING!!! ⇠March 4th, 2017 - Vaughan, Ontario  Woah!!! This isn't a vlog, nor is it a how-to video. Here's us unboxing something we ordered for a while and was so eager to receive it. We checked the mail as quickly as possible everyday, and Wednesday,  March 1st, 2017 at 5pm we received it.  Had to wait until we got together so we could record an unboxing video for you guys. This is our first impressions - We have not seen it at all. Only idea we had about it was the layout on the computer which looks SO different than in RL (RL=Real Life... For those who had no idea but didn't want to ask "stupid" questions).  We tried to keep it short, sweet, and entertaining by adding a dash of fun. See, not all unboxings are boring.   Don't forget to check out Skollgear (https://skollgear.com) for all sun-protective apparel. They strive to provide you with amazing clothing that'll protect you from the sun while you're out, and to keep you out longer to catch more. ▸ When ordering, let Skoll know we sent you & get a great deal!!  Also, to catch more fish you have to have contact one way or another. Whether it be head-on, the bottom, where ever. Woo! Tungsten gives amazing high quality weights for those flipping and drop shots. More sensitive, to have you feel everything. It's not fishing without any sort of contact. So never forget that "FISHING IS A CONTACT SPORT" and go catch some fish especially equipped with WOO!TUNGSTEN! [ DISCOUNT CODES ] ▸ ▸   Hope you liked it.

Waterway Houseboats - Shuswap Lake, British ColumbiaWithout a doubt, houseboating is one of the most relaxing and enjoyable ways to spend summertime in the Thompson Okanagan.
Washington Park, Anacortes, WA, USABeautiful views of Guemes Channel and Burrows Bay as seen from Washington Park and also the park's famous leaning tree (one of Washington state's most photographed tree) in the historic town of Anacortes on Fidalgo Island in Skagit County, Washington, USA during our trip on Sep. 3, 2011.  Washington Park is located on a peninsula at the western tip of Fidalgo Island. The 220-acre city park features camping, a boat launch, and day use picnic sites. The park juts into Rosario Strait on the western edge of Anacortes, offering territorial views. A scenic 2.3-mile one-way loop road winds through the park's forested hills and meadows with views of the San Juan Islands and Olympic Mountains. The park offers sweeping views of Guemes Channel on one side and Burrows Bay on the other.  At Sunset Beach, on the north shore, there is a boat launch, restrooms, reservable picnic shelter, playground and open play area. There are 75 campsites, restrooms, showers and laundry services in the overnight area. Picnic sites and car pullouts provide beach access along Green Point, the west shoreline. The loop road is used by cars, joggers, bicyclists and walkers.  Anacortes is the gateway to the San Juan and Vancouver Islands. Downtown Anacortes has over 125 life-sized murals painted by local resident Bill Mitchell. He painted the murals over the last 25 years from historical photographs. His art is on display all over Downtown buildings with depictions of historic scenes.

Return to Buckhorn - 1971This Super 8mm movie was shot in July 1971 at Buckhorn Narrows Campground, in Buckhorn, Ontario.  The location is in the Kawartha Lakes region of Southern Ontario.  Included in this are pictures of Buckhorn Lake, the Gannons Narrows Bridge, the Peterborough Lift Lock, and the tour of the Trent-Severn Canal from a tour boat in Downtown Peterborough, which shows the waterspray near Beavermead the CHEX-TV tower and studio facility; and Trent University where the tour boat turns around, to head back to go through the lift lock, then back to the mooring area downtown in Peterborough.  Also included are film segments of my father and his friend fishing for walleye at Buckhorn Lake, plus a site survey we did of what was to had been future places to go and rent a cabin, boat, etc.  Unfortunately, my father (the white haired gentleman) died in 1976 and we never did go as a family to that part of Ontario after 1972.    This movie was shot on Super 8 film and thus has NO AUDIO on it.  It is a historical record of my family and my parents friends from 1971, when we would vacation together.    Please leave comments and feel free to view other videos placed on YouTube.

Best of British Columbia Travel - HelloBC!!Best of British Columbia Travel for me has to be around where I lived so many years ago. The Nicola region has some amazing scenery and we saw none of the garbage and litter that is present in other parts of the province that we just traveled.  The saying is a lake a day as long as you stay and the fishing for rainbow(aka Kamloops) trout can be good.  This is fly-fishing country on small secluded lakes where you might be the only angler. Music: 'Fairy Tail' by aleksrutko  http://aleksrutko.promodj.ru/  http://www.looperman.com/tracks_detail.php?tid=23272

5 ATV Ride To The Avenger Airplane Crash - May 16 2015Cubbee leads a group of 5 ATV's to see the old Avenger Airplane crash site, well at least what is left of it.  We were hoping to be able to look for the rock igloo again along the way, but just didn't have enough time.    The wreckage is of an Avenger airplane that crashed near Dryden Ontario in 1971 while fighting forest fires. Fortunately the pilot was ok, but had quite a story to tell.  You can read all about it in an article we found from The Ottawa Citizen at the following link:  http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&dat=19710604&id=qccyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ruwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1156,1333027   We did encounter some great, smooth trails though. Nothing too challenging, but some awesome scenery along the way.   The quads with us that day were a 1000 Arctic Cat Mudpro, a 660 and 700 Yamaha Grizzly, a 550 Polaris Sportsman and a Can-Am XT 1000.

Nipissing Ontario Big Cut.mp4A video I shot while my brother piloted us through whats locally known as Big Cut. As you can see someone had a sense of humour! This was a channel blown out of the rock with explosives to link the Monetville and Noelville water channels in the West Narrows of Lake Nippissing in Ontario, Canada. Our favourite place to fish! We stay at a great place called Lakair Lodge. Kevin and Lesley are wonderful hosts. Check it out if you love fishing and the outdoors! Ordinarily the water is clear but due to a very hot summer and low water levels there was a major Blue Green algae bloom.

Beavers & Big Wheels in Logan Lake, British Columbia, CanadaKeep your wheels on the ground..seriously! I am up here at Logan Lake, British Columbia, Canada (just south of Kamloops) to check out some real estate property. With the HUGE cost of property ownership in Vancouver, Logan Lake is looking EXCELLENT!  Logan Lake is a community of about 2,100 people at an elevation of 3,600 feet about 60 kilometers (40 miles) south of Kamloops, British Columbia.   It is a friendly, clean and safe community with perhaps 35% of the people here being retired.   It is a great secret...until perhaps now! Won't you be my neighbor?  LOL.  Music used under license.

Grizzly bear encounter at Knight Inlet, B.C.Grizzly bears are the perfect symbol of Canada's untamed wilderness and to see one up close is both awe inspiring and frightening.  Although these majestic animals are found in many parts of Western Canada, one of the best places to observe large numbers of wild grizzlies is in Knight Inlet on the western coast of British Columbia. Every fall, thousands of salmon migrate from the ocean into the Glendale River to spawn and every year large groups of grizzlies gather for a salmon feast like no other.

Rowing on a puddle in the Salish SeaA morning spent rowing on Buntzen Reservoir in Anmore, near Vancouver BC Canada. July 28 2010.   A nice easy row, averaging about 17 strokes a minute. I occasionally row at about 24. But not for too long.  A few more words about this row are on the site http://rowingforpleasure.blogspot.com/2010/08/smuggerooni.html  The boat, "Miracle," is a Whitehall Spirit Solo14, "The Mountain Bike of the Sea," set up for Slide-Seat Rowing using 9.5 ft carbon-fibre oars. It is completely decked, so it has a lot of flotation.  Designed and manufactured in Victoria BC Canada, by Whitehall Rowing and Sail. The boat's hull speed is about 5 knots, or about 9 km/hr. It is quick, as you can see from the video. Not as quick as a racing or ocean shell, but with this hull I can take along my lunch, camera, tripod, water, spare shoes and jacket, extra paddle, shorter oars for rough water, boat-hook, bicycle, tent, an assortment of safety gear, and a passenger or two.

DRONE PHOTOGRAPHY - A Morning With The Ottawa Rowing Club - DJI PhantomAerial photography filmed with a DJI Phantom 3 Advanced.  The Ottawa Rowing Club is the oldest rowing club in Canada. It was founded on 6 June 1867, the same year as the Canadian Confederation. One of its founders and first patron, Sir John A. Macdonald, was Canada’s first prime minister. In early 1870s, the ORC ceased to exist before being re-introduced on 25 June 1875. The original club house was a wooden building, initially built on pontoons, and moored to the shore of the Ottawa river at the foot of parliament hill, between the Rideau canal and the Chaudière falls. Whilst the view from the club house over the Chaudière falls was picturesque, the rowing conditions were difficult: vast field of sawdust and other refuse from an immense lumber mill situated about the falls, and logs escaping from the booms. Each spring, along with the melting ice, the club house floated downstream and came aground. Every year it was brought back up near the Rideau canal. In 1884 and 1885, the club house suffered important damage when it sank. In spring 1896, the members of the Club decided to purchase a piece of the river front property at 10 Lady Grey Drive and leave the club house in its current, permanent location. An addition (the present boat house) was added to the original building. The club is just west of and below Sir John A. Macdonald's home Earnscliffe that is now the residence of the Britain's High Commissioner to Canada. With close to 1000 members, the Ottawa Rowing Club is one of the largest clubs in Canada.

Georgian Bay Gopro Dinghy Tour - Echo BayWhile we were staying at Henry's Restaurant on Georgian Bay, we took our inflatable dinghy our for a couple of hours to cruise over to a popular anchorage at 'Echo Bay'.  The south arm of that bay offers easy access and deep water, right up to shore with excellent protection form winds. The north arm is a little bit trickier to get in to, as there are shallow rocks at the mouth and only the brave ever venture into it.   At the north end of the north arm, there is a narrow and very pretty opening to the big Bay, which you'll see in this video. Always a nice venture into the area, be it Echo Bay, or any one of the dozens of other protected anchorages in the 'designated anchoring bays' of the Massasauga Provincial Park (http://www.ontarioparks.com/park/themassasauga).

Ketchikan Alaska Cruise Ship Port And Salmon Capital Of The WorldKetchikan Alaska is not only the Salmon Capital of the World it is also the rain capital of the world. Ketchikan is one of the most popular Cruise ship port destinations with a colorful downtown and unique creek street, once Ketchikan's red light district.  Ketchikan is a great place for a fishing charter even if you are only there for the day. Your catch can be cleaned, packed, and shipped home to arrive upon your return your you can surprise family or friends. There's nothing quite like getting fish in the mail.  How did Ketchikan get its name? Its unknown even what it means. Some say it means "This river belongs to Ketch" but others claim Ketchikan refers to a thundering eagle.  People are always asking me how I made these videos with cool FX. If you're interested in how I made this video on my home computer and the software I used here is a link: http://millenniumtrail.com/Video-Editing-Software.htm  Note: This video is an original work created from photos taken on my visit to Ketchikan Alaska on a cruise.

Fairmont Waterfront ~ ARC visits Haida GwaiiChef Alessandro and our team recently visited Haida Gwaii to experience where our 100% certified Ocean Wise seafood is sourced first hand.  We had an amazing time razor clamming with renowned Haida carver Reg Davidson;  mushroom foraging with Haida carver Tyson Brown and salmon fishing with Shawn Baybutt and the crew from Haida Wild.  We were overwhelmed with the hospitality that we experienced from everyone we met and completely in awe of the raw beauty of the islands.  ARC and Fairmont Waterfront are proud to partner with Haida Wild as we work together to support sustainable fishing - our goal is to source 60% of our restaurant's seafood from the pristine waters off the shores of Haida Gwaii.

Lakes and Mountains in Southern YukonThis is a video of the lakes and mountains in the area south of Whitehorse, Yukon.
Year on a Yukon CornerThe images for this video came from the first webcam we installed in the Yukon.  I waded through a year's worth of images and selected one from each day as close to 9:00 am as I could.  This is the result.  There was no logic behind the 9:00 am choice - I'm sure other time slots would have worked well also - but there are some interesting shots (even a couple of snow plows in the "right locations" to make it look like a couple of sequential shots although they're a day apart) and some beautiful skies.  One thing is for sure - it's easy to appreciate the long winters and short summers when you can watch the snow as part of the picture in one form or another from September until May...

BWCAW Sep 10-21, 2014, Fishing on Thumb Lake (39 of 113)I find a decent northern pike on Thumb Lake.  I think he was still relatively a youngster because you'll notice how big his head is and how it's disproportionate to the rest of his body.  I think he was but a teenager still in the "awkward stage".

First ATV Ride Out On The Lake - Dec. 7, 2014TEESPRING T-Shirt Campaign LINK: http://teespring.com/cubbeezx ENDS Monday DECEMBER 15th!  Finally got out for a ride....it's been awhile!! Took the Grizzly and Kodiak for a rip out on the lake. The ice appears to be anywhere from 10-18 inches thick already and it isn't even officially winter yet!  As usual the first winter ride we had a few technical difficulties with the camera and mic's but not too bad.    If you like our videos, be sure to comment, share, thumbs up and subscribe!

Veloster on a Lake (ice and snow)Check out my Veloster videos, pictures and opinions at www.velosterlover.com  I drove out to Gimli and could not resist taking my new Hyundai Veloster right out on to the ice of Lake Winnipeg.  The weather was sunny and and just below freezing,, perfect for ice fishing. I have always wanted to try ice racing and the Winnipeg Sports Car Club is scheduled to ice race on March 2,2012 at Gimli,, but I would have to buy a cheap used car for that.    Sorry there is no drifting,, there was way too much snow on the ice that I was likely to get stuck in the middle of the lake with no tow truck service.    Here are some pictures showing some of the setups I used make my Veloster videos. http://www.flickr.com/photos/74488050@N04/sets/72157629376880107/  The music is a studio recording by Gord Houghton an indy artist from Winnipeg.  This track called "Biography" is from one of his bands "Symington Yard" I used with his WRITTEN permission in exchange for giving him credit here.  Gord is supremely talented and should be making a good living from music.  Checkout this live open mic:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7P55Rmg6YI    나는 김리로 가서는 호수 위니펙의 얼음에 금방 나가 나의 새로운 현대 Veloster를 복용 저항할 수 없었다.날씨가 얼음 낚시를위한 완벽한, 햇살이었고, 단 영하. 나는 항상 얼음 경주 체험을하고 싶어했으며 위니펙 스포츠 자동차 클럽은 김리 년 3 월 2,2012에 얼음 경주 예정되어 있습니다,하지만 난 그것에 대해 저렴한 중고차를 구매해야합니다.  As of March 2013 its my second winter driving in Winnipeg, mainly city driving on all season tires.  Overall I'm impressed with the traction control and even driving pretty aggressively I have only lost control once by suddenly deciding to turn causing a sideways slid before recovering with no collision.  I had planned on buying winter tires by now, but money always ends up getting spent on something else.  If I was doing more highway winter driving I definitely would have bought them by now.  In deep snow I have been stuck, but even a police car got stuck on one of those days.  I keep a small shovel and used it twice each winter.  Some people will buy an SUV just thinking they are better in winter,, but they are no safer being so high,, hitting the ditch they are more likely to role and to me an SUV is just a taller station wagon.  SUVs, station wagons and minivans still make me cringe
The Lower Grand River Flooding at Fishmasters February 14th, 2009The water was flowing hard and fast overnight.  With an Ice Jam holding back the flow at Port Maitland, it didn't take long for the levels to rise... Thankfully we are high and dry however the water has taken over a better part of our driveway... Some on the river side of Dunnville and Broad Street didn't fare so well... Thanks go out to the fire and police departments for doing a great job and checking in on us on a regular basis!

Rapala Cruzer M2 Portable Ice Fishing Shelter Assembly - Quinte Ice Fishing TeamThe Quinte Ice Fishing Team is excited to be running a fleet of the new Rapala Cruzer portable ice fishing shelters this winter.  With our "run and gun" style of fishing, these new shelters are the perfect fit.  Here is a video of us assembling one of the Rapala Cruzer M2, two person shelters.  A mobile approach to hardwater angling can greatly increase your winter success.  While fishing from shore or boat, anglers rarely cast to or sit in a static position for very long, so why do we do this come winter?  Keep moving, cover water and stay on fish! This season Rapala introduces the RapShack Cruzer series of premium ice shelters.  Aptly named, these two flip-over style models provide the utmost in mobility, comfort and functionality.  A shelter that is easily set up by one person and ready to fish in sixty seconds while being protected from all weather conditions is fundamental to a serious ice angler's approach.  Both available options, including a one-person and two-person model were designed with a combined focus on quality and durability in construction, while keeping weight at a minimum.  The sideways sled orientation provides increased fishable area along with enough headroom for unrestricted hook sets.  The tent consists of a quality, double stitched 300 Denier fabric with reinforced corners and reflective trim for night safety and a large skirt for wind resistance.  Three removable windows via Velcro fasteners offer light and the ability to keep an eye outside, yet can be covered to darken the inside when sight fishing.  It also features a mesh storage pocket, an extra-large door with YKK zippers, and a safety ventilation system to prevent moisture build-up and CO2 exposure. The sled design is light & compact and features an oversized padded seat.  For those nicer days when a wind-block is all that you need, a special lock mechanism can be used to hold the tent in an up-right position. The one-man model also features a storage shelf.  Complete this versatile ice fishing platform with additional accessories: The RapShack Cruzer Slider Kit which aids in tracking straighter and pulls easier due to reduced friction. The RapShack Cruzer Travel Cover and RapShack Tow Bar/Hitch are essential components for anglers towing behind an ATV or snowmobile. Beyond mobility, this style of shelter provides a method to store and transport your gear to your favourite ice fishing destination. Stay mobile, and catch more fish with the Rapala RapShack Cruzer series of shelters and accessories this winter.
ice driving subaru imprezaThis is how I warm up the car after ice fishing.  Driving my impreza outback sport on ice is a blast.  The ice is about 18 inches, and the water around 20 feet.  Large trucks are driving on the lake so I feel my little car should be fine.  The first thing to do when driving on ice is to roll down the windows and take off your seat belt.

Pulling an ATV out of lake Winnipeg that went through the ice2003 Arctic Cat 4x4 400cc Quading on Lake Winnipeg and broke through the ice. Quad floated upside down tires up exposed in the water. Lassoed the wheel and then the hitch.    Pulled it out using a combo of 4 recovery straps and a 10,000 pound winch mounted to the front of a 9000 pound Diesel Ford Excursion.  Lesson learned. Even though the majority of the Lake was clear ice and 4ft thick. There was still thin ice.

RC CWR jet boating the Kananaskis River with the NQD Tear IntoSkye, Will and I went camping in Kananaskis country at the Mount Kidd campground for 5 days. And you know we brought the RCs for sure. We had a blast playing in an off shoot creek from the Kananaskis River that runs close to the campground. Will and Skye thought I need some other boats to play around with, so they took out the blue and red boats, they are just pool toys that they had in the toy bin. The weather was grey and a little rainy, the river was as cold as can be. But like crazy Canadians we loved every minute of it, even though our feet were numb. Good times.   RC CWR is Remote Control Chris Will Rappel. We are a father (Chris) 'n son (Will) team in Calgary Alberta, enjoying the hobby of RCs. Our collection of RCs include the crawlers Axial Wraith, Honcho SCX10, and Dingo SCX-10. For bashers we have the Traxxas Slash 2wd and Bandit. Drifter cars and or truck HPI Sprint 2 FLUZ and E-10. Scaler Tamiya F-350 and a cross over wraith axles under a bruiser chassis and body. Next are the Micro or mini Losi Trail Trekker and crawler customized 6X6 rally trucks flat beds and a short course truck. Another trekker is made into a custom 1/10 quad, with rider, for the axial scale adventures. We also have a 1/24 scale forklift from INDUSTRY FORK CAR, that helps out with our custom builds. 2 Forces of Valor tanks that are 1/16 scale and can shoot each other with infra red lights. Protocol helicopters one TOUGH Copter and one STEALTH HAWK. Pro Boat Mini -- V and a Blackjack 26 that is now a full time snow boat, weather permitting of course. Snowboating can be very hard on boats and boaters FYI. We have made custom built flat deck trailers and 5th wheels for our trucks to pull along on our journeys through the parks and trails around Calgary and area. Plus a custom camper that rides in the back of PJ the Jeep Cherokee. As much fun as they are to drive scale crawl or bash, we enjoy the building and planning of new builds just as much. Nothing can beat the feeling of pride when a father and son team test drive a custom designed and built RC. No sooner do we finish a build, we are already talking and planning the next build. A hobby the whole family can enjoy and have fun with. Thank you for joining us on our builds and trail runs in and around Calgary. Thanks for watching and enjoy, please subscribe LIKE and comment.
Pozdrav z ubytování na Klonajském parníkuTímto video-pozdravem zdravím své přátelé a známé z mého ubytování na parníku Klondike Spirit plavicím se po řece Yukon. ...jediná nevýhoda tohoto ubytování je dvojí: ...extra vlhká kosa, bo se ta zima natáhne do kajuty spolu z vlhkosti z ledové řeky a za druhé, každý den mezi 18 a 20 hodinou mi domov odpluje na vyhlídkovou plavbu s turisty. Jinak je to ale fajn, hlavně proto, že tohle ubytko jsem měl zadara! ...mou jedinou protislužbou bylo, že jsem vždycky večer vybafl na případně narušitele snažící se dostat na loď :)  Naštěstí tohoto dobrodružství už bude konec a já se budu moci během několika následujících dnů nastěhovat do zaměstnaneckého ubytování mého nového zaměstnavatele Hotelu Eldorádo :)

UHC Season 7 - Episode 4: The Fishing NetworkWelcome back to the fishing network! Just kidding another UHC.  Welcome to UHC Season 7!   Minecraft: Ultra Hardcore is a gamemode originally created by Guude and the group Mindcrack.   In UHC mode, health does not regenerate, you must use a golden apple or instant health potion. In addition, ghasts drop gold ingots, rather than ghast tears, so players cannot brew regeneration potions.   In this season of UHC, we have 23 participants scattered across a 2500x2500 map playing solo using the Mumble plugin that adds directional audio in-game. The last remaining player is deemed the winner. The season was recorded in a single-session.   We're using a custom plugin for UHC that automatically disables PvP for the first 20 minutes and displays episode timers.   Custom plugin and hosting provided by Mineplex.com.

And playing around with he weight balance, so the boat sits right in the water. Definitely needs some more tweaking and the body is getting closer to where I want to go with it.

I love Fishing, Girl PowerMy name is Gina R. Cowins and I believe “Paint Emotions 4-A Cure” is the right medicine. I joined the struggle and started healing hearts by making easy transitions with colors and drawings.  We can defeat low concentration spans and temporary memory loss. Get involved today and make somebody happy.  My art share telepathy experiences into the twilight zone. I enjoy people who show their artistic abilities and create visual art.  I believe each stroke, line, and curvatures are dimensions of a door in a room. We open doors to enter and exit into our lives.
RC CWR E-Revo speed run bustedSPEED RUN BUSTED out at Kananaskis Country by the COs. Just out having fun with E-Revo and traxxas slash X 2. We hit 68 km/hr top speed with 2 2S lipos and I believe stock gearing. This is the first of many speed run tests. Next will be new gearing and 2 3S Lipos. So stay tune for more of the E-Revo and by the way according to the CO the highway is not a play ground :-) We also did some racing with the slashes and we need more practise for sure LOL.

After the usual morning watering session, Matt sends Noney off to "test the waters" and see if she can't find the perfect gift.  Previous Episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9337V...  Stardew Valley is a delightful new Farm simulation RPG in a similar vein to the popular Natsume Harvest Moon series, or the Animal Crossing games, where the player takes on the role of the inheritor of an old plot of farmland in the eponymous Stardew Valley, where they are given all the tools necessary to build a life as a farmer, rancher, fisherman or even an adventurer. Befriend, even date and marry within the community, or sell the city out to the encroaching commercialism of corporate interests. The story is yours to tell.  Stardew Valley was released on February 26th, 2016, created by ConcernedApe and published by Chucklefish.   Buy Stardew Valley on Steam Here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/413...

28 6 Cabin tour, dinner of dehydrated potatoes, salmon and a fishing story Petersburg AlaskaDuring our mid-August week long stay in Petersburg, Alaska the weather had been damp. They had just come out of a good stretch of sunny weather in the high 70's, it was in the mid to high fifties during our stay, and as I write now 10 days later Sept. 2, 2009, they are again having sunny days. There is a great web cam that refreshes every 15 seconds perched on the National Public Radio Station tower in town. KFSK radio can be search engined, click on the web cam. We began planning our vacation in May of 2009. If I did not get a daily fix of the KFSK webcam, something was wrong.  Much history of the community is available on-line, Google Earth posters have left numerous photos of the community. Recently I read that a group of advisors arriving in town representing the travel industry were trying to emphasize the eco-tourism appeal of the region. The Panhandle of Alaska is as wet as any equatorial region frequented by monsoons. From some of the other movies we have posted you can see the lush nature of just this one island of which there are literally hundreds, most of them unpopulated except by wildlife.   Real Estate in the community is "By Owner", or through a local realty group named Petersburg Realty, what else? The owner of the boat rental told us he was soon selling out his boats, and would become the owner of the realty. Properties on the island ranged from undeveloped land accessible by foot through the underbrush, to undeveloped and developed properties with and without waterfront to a variety of new to older homes, several commercial properties, boats of various sizes, and a large industrial property on the shore.  Several residents stated the loss of the logging industry, (we did note a small lumber mill in operation), and a sagging fishing revenue had produced an economic doldrums effect.  Across the street from our lodging each day we saw a representative of the self employed each day tending after his crabbing business. HIs day's activities were adjusted to the tides it seemed. Some days home in the middle of the afternoon, others not arriving until dusk. A "For Sale by Owner" sign on his two story home.  The nations economy is shouldered by people. Each one makes a contributing share however small or large. People get bye during hard times. Petersburg did have a number of storefronts for lease on main street which the Taxi Driver told us recently were occupied by various gift trade shops. The regions Fish and Game office, a Division of Forestry office, a courthouse, a rest home, hospital, Alaska Airlines Terminal with two flights daily, air tours with fixed wing and helicopter, charter fishing boats, the Coast Guard has a large vessel tied in the harbor, nine churches, a pizza parlor, a sit down restaurant perched on pilings in Middle Harbor for sale by owner, a certain population of native coastal peoples, two taverns, a hardware with seemingly every item one could need in that area of life, an old paid for supermarket on main street, and a new un-paid for supermarket half way to the airport, and a reported full time population of 3008. Much of the payroll from the three major fish processors in town flies out of town with the globally mixed seasonal workers on "the slime line". At the area of the Harbormasters office evenings the tired workers gathered along the sidewalk. Numerous languages issued from various cliques along the way. Men and women have gone to the sea for ages, no different here. The processor business comptrollers and owners have found the minimum wage half way or so between $7 and $8 and time and a half for overtime more economical than the $11 or so paid to the unionized workers who once populated the canneries.  We have not wintered in Petersburg. That it is a different season we can only imagine. Rain may fall in Spain, but Little Norway gets some too. Average rainfall is 99,99 inches. That is 8,3 feet per year. Knee high brown boots that have a cream colored trim are the native wear. Rain and snow visit Petersburg, and a long gray wet winter, with shortened daylight hours prevails.

Worst hell-hole on Earth 12 - Alberta tar sands - Close-up of a tailing "pond" and its discharges into the environment.

This was proven when, this summer, 50 ducks landed into one of these "ponds", and all died. Note the oil-sheen on the surface and the dirty overflow on to the surroundings.

Kayaking in BanffKayaking and scouting some rivers near Lake Louise in Banff National Park, Alberta.
Kayaking the Spillimacheen RiverKayaking a class IV+ stretch of the Spillimacheen River in eastern British Columbia. The level was low; likely less than 9cms in the canyon (12-16cms is considered optimal). However, that was fine considering none of us had run the river before. Unfortunately, I couldn't get video of someone running every drop - there were only 3 of us and at times I had to be in my boat for safety instead of filming. It's a short (1.5km) section of river but with scouting, filming, and a bit of portaging it took us 3 hours to run.   The video shows the 7 significant rapids on the river  (no, I didn't make up the names!): 1. The dam spillway. 2. 'Birth Canal' (river-right chute through a mid-stream boulder jumble)  3. 'Astro Lube' (roostertail-riddled rock slide) 4. 'Reach Around' (sloping rock drop) 5. 'Two in the Pink' (stair-step style drop)  6. 'One in the Stink' (a.k.a. 'L drop') 7. 'Happy Ending' (20' near vertical waterfall)  Kayakers are Tom, Ben, and Dave.  Update: As of 27 October 2009, real-time gauge reading are now available at: http://scitech.pyr.ec.gc.ca/waterweb/formNav.asp
Windpaddle Sail Cameron LakeGood conditions today on Cameron Lake in Tobermory for using a Windpaddle Sail on my Tempest 165 kayak. It's a downwind sail that can do moderate cross wind sailing but is best for fairly straightforward following winds. Crossed Cameron Lake entirely without paddling at about 5km/h in approximately 18km/h winds. Paddled through the small river that connects Cameron to Cyprus lake to enjoy this short little stretch as well. The paddle back was into the wind and quite enjoyable too with a few 1 foot waves being picked up by the winds.

"OtherPeoplesTrash" Skaha Lake's West side KAYAKING-LOG: May11th2013We have beautiful lakes in the Okanagan Valley but it is sad how many take our lakes for granted. Kayaking along Skaha Lake's West side from Penticton towards Kaleden. Didn't even make it 1/3 the way and my crate was full of the trash I collected. We all need do our part to take care of our waterways before it is too late. Wish I had the room on my kayak to put all the trash on it. Styrophome, plastic, car tires, couches, chairs, trash-cans and much more. =( makes me sad that people just don't care. Our public beaches have trash cans, please use them! ~Guy   Please also watch: "When birds eats plastic!!" (Shocking video) http://youtu.be/dAL9Xvrg3hI Midway Island is an uninhabited island about 2000 km from any other coast line. It lies roughly equidistant between North America and Asia, and almost halfway around the world from England. If you think that throwing away that plastic bottle or piece of rubbish, can't possibly be doing any harm, then watch this clip and think again.  "This is sad and disgusting. Photographer Chris Jordan took pictures of dead albatrosses on the Midway Atoll, a remote cluster of islands more than 2000 miles from the nearest continent. The photos reveal a gruesome reality -- the insides of the decaying birds were filled with plastic trash. Despite being on an island far from industrial areas, the albatrosses are finding plastic bits floating in the Pacific Ocean which they eat and feed to their chicks.

McMahon Lake - Northern OntarioThis is a short video of a kayaking trip that we took in early August of 2016.  To reach Lake McMahon (or Island Lake as some people call it) you need to get in a boat on Patten Lake, portage out from the far Southwestern edge of Patten, head up a steep incline and down into a launch area on Lake McMahon.  There are only about three properties on this lake and the water is a crystal, slate blue.

You can no nothing at all about whitewater kayaking and by the end of the week, you will be ready to run rapids. I know it sounds unbelievable, if you asked me a week ago if would be running rapids, and doing rolls, and doing all of these turns, in this whitewater? I always was like, no way, I"m not going to do that, I'll probably chicken out of half of the things... But I love the way they teach the course. They do everything in a progression.  you start off just trying to get comfortable in the kayak.  You start, doing these strokes in calm water.  And then you start doing all of these exercises where you are practicing the low brace, you're practicing the high brace, you're practicing kayaking on your side. And then eventually you are going to start working on T-rescues and wet exits and this was something I was really afraid of, going upside down in the water.  But after you do it a bunch of times, by the time you are ready to go and do that wet exit in moving water, you're feeling really calm and you're ready to wait for someone to come and get you.  And hey, soon enough you'll be able to do that roll.  Dave and I were completely surprised that by 3 days in, we both had a pretty solid roll. I did the roll, I did the roll Woo! Woohoo Something I really loved is just in front of the centre, is they have all of these gates with huge water right there. And I was thinking, there's no way we're going to run that, that's just for experts right? And then here we are 4 days in, they're going "Okay we're going to run the gates. We're going to run the rapids"  I never thought that I would be a person who could even, you know, think of floating through whitewater, let alone kayaking through it and trying to find my line, and staying upright and being ok if I do tip over.  I'm so stupid! Woohoo! So by the end of your 5 day whitewater kayaking course with Madawaska Kanu Centre, you are going to be able to take those skills that you've learned and go out and feel confident to run your own, whitewater run.   Made it! Yeah.

This is a pristine area with abundant wildlife, fresh water streams feeding a small lake surrounded by forest at an altitude of 500m (1500ft) above sea level.  Location is the Eastern Townships in the province of Quebec.  Very hot summer day with a strong breeze providing relief and comfort, skies partly cloudy giving some protection from the summer sun and painting a portrait of contrasting blue and white!

Scouting the Robson River, BCScouting the Robson River near Mount Robson, British Columbia. Not the most exciting video, but it gives an idea of what the river looks like without driving all the way there and hiking 4 km only to find a pile of river-wide logjams that make most of this creek unrunnable.   If I ever run this river in my kayak, it'll probably only be the last 1km. Although the middle section above 'PhotoShot' is fairly free of wood, it's an awfully long hike for an awfully short section of river.

Patten Lake - Northern OntarioAt the northern end of Patten Lake in Northern Ontario, Canada, you can find this gorgeous slice of tranquility.  This video was recorded during a lovely afternoon in early August of 2016.   The bird you will hear with a distinctive call is a female osprey with chicks on her nest.  An osprey has nested at the top of the same dead tree in the same spot here for years.   People sometimes wonder why my family and I drive 11 hours each summer to our cabin on this remote lake.  This is my answer.  Hope you enjoy it, too.

TRAK Folding Kayak Meets the SkookumchuckJoin Jaime Sharp, James Manke, and Warren Williamson as they ride the Skookumchuck Narrows along the Sunshine Coast of BC, Canada. There is a world-famous standing wave that is caused during flooding, which results in some of the most dynamic waters and paddling on the planet. Named Skookumchuck by the early inhabitants (in Chinook, meaning "Strong Waters"), we see current at 9-10 knots during this filming. The TRAK performance folding kayak is tested and paddled by Jaime Sharp and Warren Williamson, alongside its equivalent hard-shell cousins. This is all part of the filming of The TRAK Files video series, produced by Wandering Wolf Productions.

Fraser River at 200cmsOn 1 July 2008 the Fraser River shot up to 200cms after four days of stinking hot weather ended a long, cold spring (yes, 28C is considered 'stinking hot' in Alberta).

Thought all was lost in the way of kayaking today but by supper the lake calmed and warmed up perfectly for a nice evening paddle on the lake. As we paddled the calm lake and headed up the Okanagan River Channel the sun began to set giving us an awesome Sunset Show. Hope you like the video!

Close Encounter with a Humpback WhaleEye-popping footage of a recent rare close encounter with a humpback whale off the coast of BC's spectacular Great Bear Rainforest. Whales like this one and many other coastal species are at grave risk from Enbridge's proposed pipeline to pump oil from the Tar Sands across BC and into supertankers in Kitimat, before plying some of the world's most treacherous waters en route to Asia.  This awesome creature approached a boat carrying among others filmmaker Damien Gillis, and proceeded to interact playfully with the crew for 45 minutes!  Watch highlights of this amazing and unique west coast experience - caught on camera.

Princess Maggie of KamiskotiaPrincess Maggie Buffalo (Leclair) the daughter of a full blooded Chippewa Indian was born in Nighthawk Center, North Eastern ON. Canada. She married Bill Leclair of Kamiskotia.  A character who ran away from the old age home to escape to her cabin on the shores of Kamiskotia lake where during the plague buried a husband and 2 children on an island there.  My dad said she could skin a beaver faster than you could smoke a cigarette. There's not a trace left of Maggie but my song and there's not even a grave marker in our local cemetery. However she's (apparently) buried with her husband Bill Leclair  Shame on you Timmins.  ( NO GLORY IN THIS TOWN )  You'd think Shania Twain would take up the cause to erect a proper monument as a commemoration of her life lived here after all she's from the same town. I am personally of Cherokee blood myself from the Painted Feather Woodland Metis tribe My great grandmother's  maiden name was Marguerite Levert(Raymond) whose mother Annie St.Jean married Louis Raymond.  Margaret Lewis married Mike Levert from Cheneville or St.Andre Avelin, Province of Quebec. Canada  They were married in New York somewhere ?. Ogdensburg N.Y. ?   She was a Cherokee Indian from the North Dakota Painted Feather Woodland Metis tribe.  For a great story about Princess Maggie (Not my grandmother) go to  /A memory of Maggie Leclair by Roger Gagnon  at the Timmins Times.  Princess Maggie of Kamiskotia  There was naught but rocks and forests In our little country town And that hard rock gold miner Worked the earth without a frown  Maggie was hard yet gentle And the will and strenght she showed That she could not be beaten down By the wind and winter snows   Her face was beaten by the weather And her back was bent and sore From packing moose and children Along the old Mattagami's shore  Beside Kamiskotia mountain She'd stopped and rest awhile And drink tea from a cup of birch For she had walked many weary miles  Over her fields of wheat and corn She'd sight a flock of Geese Flying in military form So high so wild so free  She represented her culture well For a proud Indian was she Like Chief Dan George the Indian She'll go down in history  The springtime sun has melted All around as you can see Except that packed down snowshoe trail Left by Maggie and me  The years have been so many Since the day you were my bride To-day the snow falls Maggie Covering all the country side  Very soon eternal spring  Will bring back the honey bees And the waters of the river  Will dance for you and me  Chorus: Just a simple song for Maggie My life my dream come true Indian blood flows in her veins And she speaks the parlez vous  Verse: We trecked across this country In the rains through woodland green Watched the Northern Lights at midnight When the clouds had blown away  And when the night time brought us home Sleeping neath the  jack pine tree We'd bathe our feet in the morning dew Just you Maggie and me  From D to E chord  And now the great of spirits Have taken her away May the ghosts of Maggie roam these valleys In Canada's great domaine  And when her search is over May she find not ill remains Of a land that was once Indian And is the white man still to blame  Recorded at Ambience Recording Studio on Rideau Street,  Ottawa.

SYLVAN LAKE HOUSE - The Main House part 1www.sylvanlakehouse.com  It's About Moments  There are no words to describe this property ... just the "moments" experienced here.   This premiere piece of Sylvan Lake is set in over 6 acres of nature's splendor teaming with flora and fauna, along 800 feet of treed cliffs along a rock bed of crystal clear lakeshore, with full panoramic view of the clean blue lake, rolling green hills, snow peaked Rocky Mountains and the big dramatic Alberta skyline.    As such, this property endeavors to give "moments" that take your breath away!  The view is an ever changing portrait as nature, weather, season and time of day ebb and flow from one mood to another.  The main and guest house are situated in the center of the 6 acres granting 400 feet of privacy in either direction -- never to be inhabited by neighbors. The property is one of the few left in Sylvan Lake with full grandfathered riparian rights to the water's edge.  It's totally privately owned and is zoned to remain so.  The back of this lakefront acreage is wrapped in enchanting woods, delivering the peaceful tranquility of nature right outside the windows in three directions (W,N,E) from dawn to dusk and from season to season.  The front faces due south overlooking the ever altering sky, hills and lake landscapes.  The large windows and decks show off the ever changing landscape views as they transform, moment after moment, season after season, year after year.    There's really no describing it ... not without experiencing it.  And to experience it, you have to be willing to relax and to engage all senses.  You will never forget it.

The actual size of Merrickville, almost 215 square kilometres, accommodates one of the largest water-based Bird Sanctuaries spanning both shores of the Rideau Canal and smaller farming communities. Travel to Merrickville is via Veterans Memorial Hwy to hwy 43 west out of Ottawa, a forty-five minute trip by car.  The attractions are the annual Jazz Fest, the Bed & Breakfast accommodations, the Blockhouse Museum, the many specialty shops and restaurants, and numerous Art Studios and galleries. In fact several of the artists live and work in the rural countryside surrounding the village, producing hot glass, jewellery, pottery, sculpture, textile arts, metal smithing and letterpress printing. For the outdoor enthusiast, and depending on the time of year, there is boating, (canoeing & kayaking), fishing, Cycling, Bird watching, Skating, snowmobiling, and Cross country Snowshoeing & Skiing.

3477 Douses Road Belle River PEI House for saleStunning Waterfront Property with Apple Orchard Available!! Originally this home was built for Lord Selkirk on PEI’s original Lot 62. When current Vendors purchased the property 25 years ago and being the 8th owners of the property, the once old farm house has been completely transformed/refurbished into the beautiful sight you will see today. The concrete foundation replaced the once upon a time island stone but the pieces of history have been preserved and used to accent this picturesque property with even the Great Wall of Belle River built at the back from the original stones. The old chicken coupe was transformed into the lovely looking cottage/shop which is left for the new owner’s interpretation and usage to finish the space inside. The property borders the Belle River which the owners use to fish for trout to impress their guests for morning breakfast. The home itself has been completely reconfigured for functionality of the space while preserving the integrity and character of the home. Everything within this home has been updated from plumbing, wiring, re-drywalled, new kitchen, bathrooms, roof has been re-shingled twice throughout the years and so much more.

Carleton Place - Ottawa Real Estate - Ottawa LivingCarleton Place is a community on Ontario’s Mississippi river and just thirty minutes outside of Ottawa to the southwest. Accessible via the 417 to Highway 7 where it sits at the intersection of three of Canada’s major highways. It is a self-sustained quaint little neighbourhood with a local economy comprised of some technological development companies along with big box retailers and smaller local shops. Additionally there is the Carleton Place Hospital located on the west end of town on High St.   The area has seen a growth spurt with the expansion of Highway 7 and the downtown area has seen a significant facelift. The community holds over 10,000 people and surrounds both sides of the Mississippi River, which is one of the many tributaries that branch off of the Ottawa River.   Local attractions include their Hockey team, the Carleton Place Canadians, Canoeing or Kayaking through the rapids in the Mississippi River, and hiking the trails along the Mississippi Valley. Occasional sightings of bald Eagles fishing might catch your eye in the O-Kee-Lee Park, along the Trans-Canada Trail and the Water Gate Nature trail where you can find the old Arklan limestone mill.  Carleton Place is great place to live with various attractions for everyone to enjoy, including the farmer’s market, Santa Clause parade, dragon boat festival, bridge street bazaar, classic car show and more. When you settle into this quiet, little community you will find that is has everything you need to raise a family.  http://www.ottawaliving.ca/community.php?community_id=167

If you have always wanted to own PEI real estate, now is your opportunity.  PEI CREA MLS (realtor.ca) Description:  11977 Route #6 Margate  Most houses are just a place to live, a kitchen, a living room, and some bathrooms. This home is a lifestyle of fun, freedom, and constant entertainment! The experience begins with a short drive up a twisty driveway to the top of a hill where you can see for many miles. Your new Prince Edward Island Home is situated on almost 5 acres of land with the ability to buy much more as an option potentially making this a fabulous hill top estate. If you are a handyman, or you just like to escape to the workshop, then you will find a massive detached garage workshop large enough to park a tractor-trailer. Entering the home from the side entrance you have a woodworking shop, and an extra-large double garage. Nothing in your new home is small in scale – not the rooms, hallways, master suite, or common areas. If you would like your new home biggy-sized, then this is for you!

"27 mai 2008 : Hello Abitibi " Travellingjon's photos around Val-d'Or, CanadaPreview of Travellingjon's blog at TravelPod. Read the full blog here: http://www.travelpod.com/travel-blog-entries/travellingjon/5/1211900400/tpod.html  This blog preview was made by TravelPod using the TripAdvisor™ TripWow slideshow creator.  Entry from: Val-d'Or, Canada Entry Title: "27 mai 2008 : Hello Abitibi !"  Entry:  "Départ beaucoup plus tard que prévu, aujourd'hui ; après m'être débarrassé de mon dilemme de félin double (je suis allé mener mes chats à l'animalerie pour la semaine), j'ai tenté de rattraper mon retard, créé par une nuit plus longue que prévue, mais ô combien reposante. Et hop, vers onze heures, l'auto est pleine de mes trucs (y compris une chaude douillette, au cas où je mettrais mon plan de dormir dans mon fidèle Sebring à exécution), et je sors de Chibougamau.  Après avoir mis quelques litres d'essence hors de prix dans mon véhicule, je vois un jeune homme sur le bord de la route 113, en train de faire du pouce en direction de Chapais (et par conséquent, de l'Abitibi-Témiscamingue, vers où je me dirige) ; me souvenant, une amère larme de nostalgie au coin de l'oeil, de mes propres aventures en tant que "hitch hiker" en France en 2006, je n'écoute que mon courage et ma bonté, et fais signe au mec en question (il s'appelle Kevin) qu'il peut monter, lui et toutes ses affaires, dans mon fidèle Sebring. Je viens de me faire non seulement un compagnon de voyage, mais également un guide routier touristique : Kevin a déjà resté à Lebel-sur-Quévillon, sur notre chemin, et il demeure présentement à Rouyn-Noranda, en Abitibi. Je le dépose donc à la fin de mon trajet pour la journée, soit Val-d'Or.  Sur la route 113, rien n'est égal ; non seulement rien ne se ressemble d'un kilomètre à l'autre, mais en plus nous avons toutes les températures, en cette fin de mai : pluie faible, pluie forte, grêle, nuages menaçants, vent, soleil. Plusieurs fois, je dois ralentir pour pouvoir conduire d'une façon digne de ce mot. Et c'est sans compter les petits villages que nous rencontrons, dont certains font franchement pitié (je ne spécifierai pas le(s)quel(s), pour ne pas offusquer personne) : la communauté Crie de Waswanipi, et les minuscules postes de Desmaraisville et Miquelon (voir photos) ; ces deux derniers ont moins de 50 habitants permanents. Un peu avant 14 heures, nous arrivons à Lebel-sur-Quévillon, frontière du Nord-du-Québec et de l'Abitibi, du côté NDQ ; nous y faisons un arrêt, surtout que Kevin désire aller dire un p'tit bonjour à sa maman chérie avant de continuer. Re-départ vers 14h30.  À partir de là, aucun arrêt jusqu'à Val-d'Or ; en fait, il n'y a pas grand-chose à voir entre les deux. C'est vrai, la route est plus belle, les arbres plus colorés et la température plus clémente, mais les 425 km qui séparent Chibougamau de ma destination finale commencent à me peser. Nous arrivons enfin à Val-d'Or juste avant le souper. Je dépose Kevin près de chez un de ses amis, et je me réserve une chambre d'hôtel tout près du centre-ville, au Prélude, un 3 étoiles sympathique (eh oui, j'ai laissé tomber mon projet hippie de dormir dans mon fidèle Sebring ce soir, mais ça m'a quand même coûté 93 balles...). Après souper, au McDo, beurk, je pars digérer tout ça en marchant un peu danns Val-d'Or. La ville n'est pas impressionnante ni exagérément belle, mais elle a un certain dynamisme ; elle m'a fait un peu penser à Chicoutimi et Alma (Saguenay Lac). Bref, je suis content d'être arrivé, et j'aime bien mon premier contact avec l'Abitibi à vie. Je me couche plutôt tôt (vers les 22 heures), question d'être le moindrement frais pour le lendemain matin ; en soirée, j'ai écouté "Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain", pour la énième fois, sur mon lecteur DVD portatif. Le confort de la maison, en voyage. Demain, 489 kilomètres, dont plus de 275 dans le Parc de la Vérendrye m'attendent." Read and see more at: http://www.travelpod.com/travel-blog-entries/travellingjon/5/1211900400/tpod.html  Photos from this trip: 1.

RC CWR Hold Fast WR8 Rally SeriesHPI WR8 rally time, loving this car. I'm thinking of doing a series of rally videos, maybe do a couple of videos a month. Rallying in different areas but this style of video, what do you guys think. The Hold Fast thing is a Scottish crest and being part Scott an lovin the crest. I thought it was the perfect name for a rally race series of videos. I have a feeling there will be another 1 or 2 WR8s to join the rally series in the future, making for some crazy videos. Let me know what you think and leave a comment below. As always thanks for watching and enjoy, Cheers.

RC CWR Canadian Ice Drifting with HPI Flux Sprint 2, E-10 and Vaterra Cop CarThe kids and I took the drifters out with onroad touring tires for some ice drifting at our local skating park. Will and I traded back and forth with the red truck HPI Sprint 2 and Vaterra cop car while Skye was driving the white Dodge HPI E-10. The stock Vaterra tires worked awesome on the ice and handled the best, going to have to get some for the other 2 trucks for sure. If anyone knows of a good touring tire for ice let me know thanks. Half way through the video we head up to the bike path for some high speed runs and snow bashing. We all had a blast and it was nice to get out the drifters again.

Paull River - The Long WayIn August 2015 our family (Tom, Deb, Rohan and Ruth) joined another family (Thomas, Sara, Aria, Gaby and Maya) for a three-week canoe trip into the wilderness of Saskatchewan and back again. The children ranged in age from just turned 2 to just turned 12.  Our goal was to get to the Paull River without the use of an airplane, but like many adventures the best part of it all wasn't what we thought it would be.  Our route started at Besnard Lake and headed north, through Besnard Creek, the Churchill River at Black Bear Island Lake, then into Sandy River and on towards the Paull River just downstream of Paull Lake. From there we followed the trade route back to the Churchill and on towards Missinipe.  The journey to the Paull took almost two weeks and ended up being the highlight of the trip despite being mostly upstream and lake travel with many portages, many of which were grown over pretty good from decades of disuse. The cruise down the Paull and onto the Churchill, with its established portages and whitewater was fun of course but we finished the trip longing for the unbeaten path.

A "Day" in Nova Scotia, Canada, via DJI Phantom 3 droneExperience a "day" in stunningly beautiful Nova Scotia, Canada, from sunrise to sunset.  It is absolutely amazing how much this province has to offer... rugged yet gentle, exciting yet serene, modern yet historical.  This is how I have experienced Nova Scotia over a six-month period.  It is not intended to fully capture the province, as there are MANY parts I've yet to visit.  However, the video is intended to be only one in a series of "A 'Day' in Nova Scotia" videos that I will be continuing on this YouTube channel.  The footage was recorded between June and December 2015, and was shot using a DJI Phantom 3 Advanced drone.

Kamloops Lake - Unusual Helicopter ManeuversKamloops Lake in British Columbia, Canada is situated on the Thompson River just west of Kamloops. The lake is 1.6 km wide, 29 km long, and up to 152 m deep. The community of Savona is located at the west end of the lake on the Thompson River. The city of Kamloops is located a few miles east of the head of the lake, at the confluence of the North and South Thompson Rivers.  The lake is bounded on all sides by steep embankments, with level areas found only near creek deltas and around the inlet and outlet. The surrounding land is mostly uninhabited. It is classified as dry belt interior grasslands, composed of bunchgrass and sagebrush with pockets of Douglas fir, Ponderosa pine and spruce.  Kamloops Lake is a widening and deepening of the Thompson River, which enters at the east end and exits at the west end. The limnology of the lake is controlled by the Thompson River, which has large fluctuations in annual flow, with over 60% occurring in the early summer during freshet (May to July). Lake levels rise naturally as much as 30 feet (9.1 m) from high season in June compared to low season. Conversely, beach areas expand by as much as 200 feet (61 m) in the summer as lake levels recede after freshet.  Bulk residence times are very short (the time it takes for the water in the lake to be replaced with new water), ranging from 20 days to 340 days, with a mean of 60 days. Because Kamloops Lake is fed by both the North and South Thompson rivers (the South Thompson drains from the very warm Shuswap Lakes), Kamloops Lake is a very warm lake. Since the late twentieth century, it has become an increasingly popular boating and recreational area. On the north side of the lake is Fredrick, and on the south side of the lake are residential subdivisions such as Cherry Creek and the Tobiano resort community. A boat launch, trestle and gas dock have been built at Tobiano; it is the only location on Kamloops Lake with these facilities. Both Savona and Kamloops also have boat launches, but their use is limited in the later summer months of low water.

The Bird flying is a Bald Eagle and numerous Whitetail & Mule deer can be seen as well as Wapiti/Elk, Buffalo and Sheep. Also some footage of us chasing a Coyote. Many thanks to the family who own the premises and Helicopter for their wonderful hospitality as well as a fantastic ride in a Helicopter which was a first for my wife.  Negative/Slanderous comments with vulgarity & spam posted will be deleted.

Read the full blog here: http://www.travelpod.com/travel-blog-entries/frenchpeg/westcanada2007/1168777320/tpod.html  This blog preview was made by TravelPod using the TripAdvisor™ TripWow slideshow creator.  Entry from: Yellowknife, Canada Entry Title: "Yellowknife"  Entry:  "Yellowknife  Après ma première journée de mon périple de 2 semaines dans l'ouest canadien passée dans les aéroports et les avions de 7h heure de Montréal à 2h30 le lendemain matin heure de Yellowknife (-2h par rapport à Montréal)!!, j'ai enfin réussi à atteindre Yellowknife à 2h30 du mat dimanche où Steph lui avait réussi à arriver dès 14h samedi! (Résumé de la journée galère : au lieu de faire une réservation Montréal-Yellowknife directe, j'avais fait l'erreur de prendre 2 résa Montréal-Calgary / Calgary-Yellowknife ; m'étant rendu compte de cette potentielle source de problème, je l'ai mentionné à l'enregistrement à Montréal où on m'a dit qu'ils pouvaient rien faire et que je devrais sortir mes bagages à Calgary et les réenregistrer... Moi évidemment, j'ai pas insisté puisqu'elles avaient l'air catégorique... Grave erreur!... Ce contre-temps ainsi qu'une 1/2h de retard dû au vent m'a fait rater ma connexion à Calgary que Steph lui a réussi à prendre de justesse ... J'ai ensuite passé une heure avec un adorable agente à Calgary pour récupérer cette erreur des Montréalaises qui auraient en fait, paraît-il, totalement pu m'éviter ça (ça a été long du fait du pass au sein duquel on ne peut rien annuler sans encourir des frais et qui est nouveau donc les agents savent pas trop encore comment le gérer)... Bref, je me suis retrouvée à devoir prendre un vol Calgary-Edmonton (déjà en retard d'1h à cause du temps dans les Prairie) puis Edmonton-Yellowknife qui s'est avéré en retard de 4 heures (du fait d'un problème de pare-brise qui les a fait chercher un autre avion ailleurs... et puis, (histoire de bien éprouver ma patience remarquable ce jour-là, faut quand même l'avouer) un manque de personnel à minuit et quelque à Edmonton pour charger les bagages dans l'avion).... Bref arrivée à 2h30 du mat à Yellowknife.... mais au moins, j'ai pu faire tout mon travail dans les divers aéroports... Vive Air Canada ;-) Donc ce matin, dodo et puis on est allé chercher un resto par -38°C (ressenti -45°C!!)... oui oui... on est un peu débiles... voir les photos ci-dessous :) :) :) On est revenu à l'hôtel pour s'organiser notre journée de demain (voir plus bas) et puis on est ressorti se promener dans la neige et on a traversé le lac gelé pour aller jusqu'à la "vieille" ville où on a finit dans un bistro/resto de pêcheurs réputé ici (pas traditionnel comme on pourrait l'imaginer mais couvert de photos de jeunes touristes un peu fous, de blagues (du genre "Personne n'est parfait... je suis Personne") et tenu par des lesbiennes... toute une expérience) Après retour énergique pour braver la température et livraison de mes boulos pour demain matin heure de Dublin! Programme de demain : sortie en traineau à chiens de midi et quelques à 16h puis soirée aurores boréales de 20h à minuit dans un village avec des tipis et des fauteuils chauffants!! On vous racontera!! Il devrait faire moins froid quand même demain, car aujourd'hui, il n'y avait même pas de sortie traineau à chieins car il faisait trop froid! On doit aussi, avant de partir ou entre les deux sorties, manger avec une fille de Yellowknife rencontrée dans l'avion et qui m'a déposé à l'hôtel à 2h du matin avec son chum... les retards dans les avions, ça crée des liens.... :) Photos de Yellowknife (pour les novices, c'est dans les Territoires-du-Nord-Ouest, à 2h en avion au nord de Calgary... le grand nord canadien pratiquement la même latitude que Whitehorse dans le Yukon en fait)  Comme je suis arrivée à 2h30 du mat, inutile de vous dire que j'ai rien vu du tout de Yellowknife en arrivant... Ce matin, je tire mes rideaux et première image de Yellowknife (pour les novices, c'est 2h en avion au nord de Calgary... le grand nord canadien à la même latitude que Whitehorse en fait:  Un peu plus tard (14h, si si... le soleil va pas bien haut ici...) sur les "dunes" qui bordent le lac...  Grand lac de l'Esclave (big Slave's lake)   Mais puisque je vous dis que c'est un loup!! Il était tout seul, avait plus que 3 pattes... enfin bon... on saura jamais.... mais ça ressemble bien quand même....  Portraits de gens un peu fêlés.... :) ..." Read and see more at: http://www.travelpod.com/travel-blog-entries/frenchpeg/westcanada2007/1168777320/tpod.html  Photos from this trip: 1.

Saskatchewan is not a huge tourist province. It's pretty much all the same; flat. I guess sometimes the flat is broken by "slightly lumpy". Most of the Cities have by pass routes that keep you away from the better parts of the City when driving through. I've been amazed at Cities that I've driven through a dozen times, when I've strayed from the normal route. One radio commercial trying to attract people to (or rather, keep people in) Saskatchewan has a line that goes: "just because most of us come from small towns, doesn't mean that we are all hicks".

But not being in a hurry has advantages and we opted to detour south a bit to see what Last Mountain Lake had to offer.

Canada's largest light weight rental canoe fleet is hosted here, along with a wide selection of kayaks and even four 26' Voyageur canoes for group outings.

Get your paws off my beaver - Senator Nicole Eaton YouTubeConservative Senator Nicole Eaton wants to replace the beaver as Canada's national animal emblem. What's wrong with the beaver? What's the beaver ever done to her? Beavers are good, Canadians love their beaver. Beavers are cute and furry. I like the beaver.  Dam building can be very beneficial in restoring wetlands. Such wetland benefits include flood control downstream, biodiversity (by providing habitat for many rare as well as common species), and water cleansing, both by the breakdown of toxins such as pesticides and the retention of silt by beaver dams. Over the eons, this collection of silt produces the rich bottom land so sought after by farmers. Beaver dams reduce erosion as well as decrease the turbidity that is a limiting factor for much aquatic life. While beavers can create damage, part of the problem is one of perception and time scale.   A beaver dam has a certain amount of freeboard above the water level. When heavy rains occur, the pond fills up and the dam gradually releases the extra stored water. Often this is all that is necessary to reduce the height of the flood wave moving down the river, and will reduce or eliminate damage to human structures. Flood control is achieved in other ways as well. The surface of any stream intersects the surrounding water table. By raising the stream level, the gradient of the surface of the water table above the beaver dam is reduced, and water near the beaver dam flows more slowly into the stream. This further helps in reducing flood waves, and increases water flow when there is no rain. Beaver dams also smooth out water flow by increasing the area wetted by the stream. This allows more water to seep into the ground where its flow is slowed. This water eventually finds its way back to the stream. Rivers with beaver dams in their head waters have lower high water and higher low water levels  Beaver ponds can cause the removal of nutrients from the stream flow. Farming along the banks of rivers often increases the loads of phosphates, nitrates and other nutrients, which can cause eutrophication and may contaminate drinking water. Besides silt, the beaver dam collects twigs and branches from the beavers' activity and leaves, notably in the fall. The main component of this material is cellulose, a polymer of β-glucose monomers (This creates a more crystalline structure than is found in starch, which is composed of α-glucose monomers. Cellulose is a type of polysaccharide.) Many bacteria produce cellulase which can split off the glucose and use it for energy. Just as algae get their energy from sunlight, these bacteria get their energy from cellulose, and they form the base of a very similar food chain. However, a source of energy is not enough for growth. These bacterial populations face serious shortages of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds, and will absorb these nutrients as they pass by in the water stream. In this way, these and other nutrients are fixed into the beaver pond and the surrounding ecology, and are removed from the stream.  Agriculture also introduces herbicides and pesticides into streams. Some of these toxicants are metabolized and decomposed by the bacteria in the cellulose-rich bottom of a beaver dam.  A Canadian ecologist has discovered the world's largest beaver dam in a remote area of northern Alberta, an animal-made structure so large it is visible from space.  Researcher Jean Thie said Wednesday he used satellite imagery and Google Earth software to locate the dam, which is about 850 meters (2,800 feet) long on the southern edge of Wood Buffalo National Park.  Average beaver dams in Canada are 10 to 100 meters long, and only rarely do they reach 500 meters.   music by 01 - zero-project - 01 - Land of legends

Temagami 8 Day Canoe Trip - Part 2 of 2 (2009)This is the footage taken from an eight day canoe trip I did with a friend of mine in the Temagami region in Ontario, Canada. It was my first trek in Temagami and it proved to be a tough go but worth every effort. It's worth noting that a good chunk of the trip wasn't actually in a park at all, hence some difficult portages. The route involved about 41 lakes and rivers and I have a full one hour trip log in the wings that I will likely be posting on a future date to help anyone who would like to do this same trip or sections of it. To outline the loop we did, some of the bodies of water involved - starting with: Red Squirrel Lake, Eagle Lake, Sir Devon Lake, Lady Evelyn Lake, Sucker Gut Lake, Lady Evelyn River  - South Channel, Diamond Lake, Sharp Rock Inlet and back to Red Squirrel Lake.  Thanks for watching and I hope you enjoy it...
Alaska to Texas, Day 1 - The Final Goodbye to Alaska - VLog 60, 06/19/201206/19/2012 Anchorage, Alaska, USA to Beaver Creek, Yukon Territory, Canada  ---  I'm going to miss this state... But at the same time, I know I'm going to a place that will better suit my needs. So on the way out... Gassed up THREE TIMES, drove through a thunderstorm with sheet rain you couldn't see a 1/4 mile through, a couple construction bypasses... And we land in Beaver Creek around 11:20PM Pacific time. Wow. My first self-driven excursion out of my home country.. LOL!  So this video was a lot longer than I had anticipated or hoped for... lol. Took an entire 6 hours plus to work it... 68 total separate video clips between two cameras, rendered 4 times through two different editors.... LOL, good times.

Quel superbe endroit ici, je me sens vraiment gâtée d'avoir ma petite plage privée (même si c'est juste 30FT de plage). Au loin je pense qu'on est supposés voir un géant couché. Je me suis bien imaginé qu'un tel site devait être populaire alors me je suis rendue au kiosque d'enregistrement mais malheureusement, quelqu'un avait réservé mon site pour ce soir. J'ai demandé si celui d'à côté était également réservé, oui, l'autre d'après, oui, oui, oui, donc, l'ado de 16 ans derrière le comptoir ne semblait aucunement motivée à me trouver un autre terrain de camping alors j'ai décidé de plier bagage et aller dormir plus loin. De toute façon j'ai mon site jusqu'à 2PM et ensuite je peux aller faire de la randonnée.  J'ai enfin découvert qui est le roi de la plage ici (je trouvais ça bizarre aussi qu'il n'y ait ni insectes, ni oiseaux, ni mammifères...) - j'ai trouvé la réponse après que la majorité des campeurs soit partie et lorsque l'équipe de nettoyage est arrivée - les canards! Ils se promenaient de site en site et mangeaient tout ce qu'ils pouvaient trouver, lorsqu'ils m'ont aperçu ils sont tout de suite venus me voir, mais ce n'était pas des canards terroristes, ils sont partis quand je leur ai dit de s'en aller. Je les ai observés dans leur tâche pas très ardue de se goinfrer de site de camping en site de camping. Je le savais qu'il devait y avoir un roi de la plage (ou des reines).  Une fois bien installée tranquillement sur la plage avec mon café et un de mes super magaines, je me suis fait amie avec un canard qui est calmement venu s'installer à côté de moi pour faire sa longue toilette personnelle, après quoi il s'est endormi tout près de moi, presque comme un animal de compagnie. Son frère ou sa soeur est venu me voir aussi, par contre ce canard là était plus actif et il m'a fait sa plus belle face de quêteux - j'ai dû le faire s'en aller de quelques mouvements de la main, ce qui a réveillé mon nouvel ami qui s'en est allé lui aussi. Je me suis même permis une petite baignade dans le lac (pas une grande baignade, je n'aime pas trop ça jouer dans l'eau). Moi, dans un lac, toute seule! Que je m'étonne des fois! La seule raison (les seules devrais-je dire) c'est que le lac était super clair, propre, pas profond, et très chaud! C'est très rate que je me plonge dans l'eau (comme vous commencer à le savoir, je suis une poltronne dans ben des situations, incluant les lacs profonds et noirs).  Il était déjà le temps de partir! Je me suis arrêtée au centre d'information pour avoir des suggestions, et j'y ai appris qu'il y avait une mine d'argent abandonnée tout près, à Silver Inslet. Cette mine était située sur un tout petit bout de terre et se trouvait sous l'eau, à 381m (1250FT) de profondeur - c'était même pendant un certain temps la mine d'argent la plus riche au monde. La mine était difficile d'accès, il était difficile de fournir un logement pour tous les mineurs, la seule source d'air dans la mine venaient de tuyaux qui sortaient à la surface de l'eau, les bottes à cap d'acier n'existaient pas encore, et la seule lumière disponible dans la mine était à la lueur des chandelles!!! Quand même, entre 1868 et 1884 la mine a produit pour 3.25M$ d'argent, un très grande richesse dans ce temps là. En voyant la mine des airs (par des photos) jamais on ne dirait qu'il y a un si grand trésor caché sous l'eau! Je suis allée au magasin général de ce temps-là, et j'ai résisté à la tentation des belles grosses tartes cuisinées sur place. J'avais l'intention d'aller marcher, pas d'aller faire une sieste après m'être gavée!  Je m'en allais ..." Read and see more at: http://www.travelpod.com/travel-blog-entries/gensphoto/1/1280946250/tpod.html  Photos from this trip: 1.

Boating Overnight At BobcaygeonA few days into our 2014 summer boat cruise, we made a stop at the lock in Bobcaygeon, Ontario. Although we had been through this way many times in the past, this would be our first time spending a night on the lock tie up wall.   As this video will attest, it is simply one more gem along Ontario, Canada's 240 mile long Trent Severn Waterway. Located within the City of Kawartha Lakes, the term 'Kawartha' translates to 'Land of Shining Waters' and aptly so.   Much of this video was captured using my Sony HXR NX30U video camera, and I continue to be impressed with the fantastic video quality it produces!

Bay of Fundy, Maitland, Nova Scotia - Canada HD Travel ChannelThe Bay of Fundy located between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick is known for the world's highest tides. Low tide and high tide in the Bay of Fundy can be watched particularly well at Maitland nearby Truro. The highest tides of all times with 21 m was measured here. Depending on lunar phases and the seasons the tides during our visit was at about 14 m. At low tide, the landscape is wide and open; high tide pushes the sea further into the bay. The changes of the landscape in a very short time is really amazing and this happens twice a day.  In the video we show several times the same stretch of coastline twice; once at low tide and once at high tide.  At high tides it is popular to do rafting in the onrushing wave. The sunset's spectacular play of colours can be best viewed from the water.  We find a cozy accommodation in Captain Douglas House. The friendly family house is a heritage designated property built in 1860, by a sea captain named Captain William Douglas. For the first time we make the acquaintance  to the Canadian mosquito in Maitland which has spared us on our trip through eastern Canada till now. ..... please read more: https://blog.myvideomedia.com   Die Bay of Fundy, eine Bucht zwischen Nova Scotia und New Brunswick,  ist bekannt für den höchsten Tidenhub der Welt.  Bei Maitland, in der Nähe von Truro, lassen sich Ebbe und Flut der Bay of Fundy besonders gut beobachten. Hier wurde der höchste Tidenhub aller Zeiten mit 21 m gemessen. Abhängig von Mondphasen und der Jahreszeit, ist der Tidenhub während unserem Besuch bei etwa 14 m. Bei Niedrigwasser wirkt die Landschaft weit und offen, bei Flut drängt das Meer immer weiter in die Buchten. Es ist erstaunlich, welchen Veränderungen die Landschaft in kürzester Zeit unterworfen ist und dies zweimal täglich. Im Video zeigen wir öfters die gleichen Küstenabschnitte zweimal hintereinander; einmal bei Ebbe und einmal bei Flut. Bei Flut ist es beliebt, in der hereinbrechenden Welle, Rafting zu betreiben. Gleichzeitig lässt sich vom Wasser aus am besten das Farbenspiel der untergehenden Sonne beobachten. Wir finden eine gemütliche Unterkunft im Captain Douglas House. Die freundliche Familienpension ist ein altes Kapitänshaus, erbaut 1860 vom Kapitän zur See William Douglas. In Maitland machen wir zum ersten Mal die Bekanntschaft der kanadischen Stechmücke, die uns auf unserer Reise durch den Osten Kanadas bisher überall verschont hatte. ......

One night at Ricardo'sWe met Sue and Ricardo, owner operators of Ricardos Mediterranean Kitchen in Winfield BC on Wednesday. We returned Thursday night and you could have knocked me over with a feather. This place was packed. We talked with several customers and nothing but praise was said. Quality, value, service, atmosphere and a friendly environment does work. What a novel approach. One last thing, homeowners on shows like 'House Hunters' are always looking for homes with large modern kitchens, with an Island if possible. They need space for cooking. The Kitchen where Ricardo performs his magic is perhaps 4 feet wide by 12 feet long, so it goes to show that it's not the size of your kitchen that counts, it's the love of cooking.  Gordon Ramsey, the challenge, should you except, is spend a busy night in this kitchen preparing several hundred dishes, then you will know a real Hell Kitchen. Find Ricardo's Mediterranean Kitchen: http://www.ricardos.ca/
lac la bicheThe Lac La Biche region has a long and colourful history. Famous explorer and mapmaker David Thompson travelled through the region in 1798 on his way to find the elusive Northwest Passage. The Hudson’s Bay Company established a fort at Lac La Biche in 1799 and Oblate Catholic priests officially established Lac La Biche Mission in 1853. The mission is now a popular National Historic Site, located 16 kilometres northwest of present day Lac La Biche.  The County is famous for its many lakes, most notably Lac La Biche Lake, which is a French translation of a Cree phrase, meaning "Lake of the Elk". In addition to lakes, rivers and streams, the County's topography features forests, farmland, muskeg, and dozens of recreation areas and trails.  Lac La Biche is the second-oldest established community in Alberta and has one of the oldest Metis settlements in Alberta, along with Lac St. Anne, St. Albert and St. Paul De Metis. The region was an ideal place to develop trade and communities because of its strategic access to the Churchill and Mackenzie drainage basins, abundant wildlife, fertile soil, pristine environment and good transportation routes - first by water and then by rail and roads.  Home to Aboriginal people for thousands of years, settlement in Lac La Biche brought together a multicultural mixture of ethnic groups, anchored by Cree, English, French, Italian, Lebanese, Metis, Russian and Ukrainian populations. While much of Lac La Biche County has French Canadian origins, the hamlets of Venice and Hylo were established as Italian agricultural colonies. The region has one of the largest Muslim populations per capita in Canada. When the  Al Kareem Mosque was constructed in 1958, it was only the second one in Canada.  Lac La Biche County was created in 2007 when the Town of Lac La Biche and Lakeland County amalgamated. It is one of the largest municipal districts in Alberta and is adjacent to four Aboriginal communities: Beaver Lake Cree Nation, Heart Lake First Nation, Kikino Metis Settlement and Buffalo Lake Metis Settlement. In addition, it has two urban centres - Lac La Biche and Plamondon – and many smaller hamlets and rural subdivisions.  The region boasts thriving agriculture, oil and gas, forestry, tourism and service industries, and has a wide variety of amenities and services for all age groups. The area is rich in natural resources, particularly oil and gas in the northeast portion of the County, which is a major economic driver. The energy industry is leading the way in economic growth and fuelling a bright, prosperous future for the County and its residents.

Grundy Lake Provincial ParkWe stayed here for a couple of days before our 1st trip down the French River. We were going do backcountry here but the sites were either swampy, too close, or overgrown. We did how ever get to practice some map reading and portaging. We paddled Grundy, Gut, and Gird Lakes on the Monday. With 2 portages totalling 125 m  and the cliffs on Gut Lake ( the kids are cliff jumping ) it was an enjoyable 30 degree day. The scenery was beautiful too many people for our liking although ten years ago when our 3 boys were younger we could have easily spent a week here without ever being bored. Tuesday we drove to the Lake Pakeshkag access  paddled through from here to a 10 m portage into  Sicle Lake then a short paddle came to a 160 m portage over railway ( Don't stick around on the tracks blind corners and fast trains) down into Rapidfoot Lake the falls here are really pretty and being the only ones to carry our canoe over the hill after leaving the falls area we had Rapidfoot Lake to ourselves we paddled a short distance 2 km up Pakeshkag River water was shallow and many beaver dams we returned to Rapidfoot  and explored the island. Grundy Lake Provincial Park is a great spot for an introduction to backcountry canoeing well still being close to help if you were to need it or forget something. Grundy does have one bad point that is the close proximity to both Highway 69 ( don't stay on Clear Lake it is directly across from 69 ) and two busy railway lines on its south and east boarders ( The backcountry campsite on Rapidfoot Lake is 500 m from busy railway with long freights all hours )

Kayak Tripping- Dog Lake AdventureProject WetPaddles -  May Long weekend 2011.  I was packed up for 2-4 nights in my kayak.  Went to a usual camping spot, on an island.  Got to try out my new MEC Super tarp and it came in real handy!  You can see I pack very heavy for what I'm doing but, I like to have lots of gear to fool around with when I'm alone..  I'm not content just sitting around reading so packing and fiddling with gear is why I go!

French River Expeditionhttp://frontierbushcraft.com/expeditions/canoe-canada-french-river/  The Frontier Bushcraft French River Expedition combines a superb journey on a Canadian Heritage River with comprehensive instruction in skills for travelling, camping and staying safe in this environment.  The trip starts with a orientation and training phase spanning a couple of days.  We then set out on an 8-day journey which includes spending two days with The Dokis First Nation, learning more about the land and their traditional view of it.  The French River is one of the most important waterways in the history of Canada. A travel route of the Ojibwa serving as a conduit for explorers and missionaries, the French River later became a key link in the fur trade.   The area provides great opportunities for employing canoe and bushcraft skills. Indeed, in this environment, they fit together perfectly.  The French River expedition is Frontier Bushcraft's foundation-level Canadian canoeing trip. The trip is led by canoe legend Ray Goodwin and renowned bushcraft instructor Paul Kirtley.  As well as giving you all the skills you need to make your own journeys here, the trip provides a firm basis for our more demanding and remote canoe expeditions such as on the Bloodvein River.   On the Frontier Bushcraft French River Expedition you can expand, hone and integrate your bushcraft and expedition canoeing skills with solid experience and expert guidance.

Calgary to Vancouver Island in Winter - time lapse - part 3 of 7This is the third video of my trip out to Vancouver Island.  As I was leaving Alberta we were experiencing chinook conditions.  Since a chinook is producing by Pacific air moving across the mountains, losing moisture and getting compressed warming the air up, I knew that I would experience a lot of snow as I drove West.  This was the day I hit the snow.  A snowfall warning was issued for this region, but fortunately there wasn't much traffic on the road except for a few semis.  Unfortunately,  the mountains are not visble at all due to the snow.  For comparison, you might wish to check out my video "Calgary to Vancouver - time lapse - part 3 of 5" which shows the same stretch of highway.  This video begins in Golden, BC which is where the Kicking Horse river flows into the Columbia river.  From Golden, the Trans-Canada highway follows the Columbia river on its Northbound course for a short while then climbs over the Selkirk range of mountains via the Rogers Pass (1330m elevation) and reaches Revelstoke, BC.  This range of mountains is known for getting a lot of snow in winter - around 10m per year.  The mountains in this area are also quite steep.  This combination leads frequent avalanches in the area.  Both the highway and the railway line are protected by avalanche sheds in stategic spots.     This was filmed on Feb. 4, 2011 at 20x real time.    The music used is Every Night, Every Day by Traffic.
Trip across Lake Huron on my Bayliner Avanti 3250In the spring of 2008 I decided to make a short documentary of me and my 32' Bayliner crossing Lake Huron. The trip started in Sarnia and ended in Tobermory. I was single-handed and it was an adventurous thing to do. I made sure I always wore my PFD in case I fell overboard. The trip took 9 hours and $1500 in gas. It was well worth it for the bragging rights at my marina.
Pelion Mountain, Tantalus Range in Squamish BC, Ski MountaineeringKevin and I had last minute plans to summit Pelion before we both had to leave for the summer, I've read trip reports of people skiing in and summiting within the day, or even doing the whole Tantalus traverse in a day! However, we wanted to take our time so we loaded up our enormous packs with plans to spend the night and summit early in the morning. Looking back it would have been a lot easier to take super light day packs and just go for it in a day.  Just under 200m from the summit we decided to turn around, the ski down was very icy but we still had a long enjoyable ski back to camp, and back to the river where we had to switch back to walking.  https://www.instagram.com/blake.mcintyre/ https://www.facebook.com/blakemcintyrephotography/ http://www.blakemcintyre.com/
Saskatoon to Chilliwack BC in under 10 minutes!** Smart people read the description! **  I drove back to Chilliwack from Saskatoon so I could finish moving some of my stuff. Decided to take a time lapse video so you can see roughly how the drive from the Prairies to nearly the South Coast of BC is.   Couple of notes regarding what you will see here:  - I left Saskatoon at 4am local time. This was far too early. The first stop you see is me getting about 45 minutes of sleep in the parking lot of a KFC in Kindersley. - I didn't account for rain when I first mounted my camera. It does rain briefly, but eventually does go away. - For some reason, I lost about 45 minutes of pictures, so you will see a sudden "edit" in the middle. Don't think anything of significant value was really missed. :) - The mount for my camera decided it didn't like where it was, so it fell down. I remounted it under my rear view mirror which seemed to work better - at least the wipers were now wiping the view of the camera. - At the end as I near Chilliwack, the camera couldn't handle the direct sunlight, so the image gets a but wonky. Sorry bout that.. not much I can do.  Oh, and did I say camera? These pictures were taken on a Motorola Atrix 4G. 1024x768 resolution shot once every 4 seconds. Total drive time was 13.5 hours, including the sleep break in Kindersley and the time change back to PST just west of Golden, BC.  This was the route I took: http://g.co/maps/jnw49  Tracks Used: Boards of Canada - Dayvan Cowboy Boards of Canada - Skyliner

They feature winter sports held on snow or ice, such as Alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, figure skating, bobsledding and ice hockey. Cross-country skiing, figure skating, ice hockey, Nordic combined, ski jumping, and speed skating have been competed at every Winter Olympics since 1924. Other athletic events have been added  since.  Some of these events, such as luge, short track speed skating, and freestyle skiing have earned a permanent spot on the Olympic program. The first Winter Olympics were held in Chamonix, France in 1924. Prior to this, figure skating and ice hockey had been events at the Summer Olympics.    Many countries have played home to the Winter Olympics. France has been host to the Games three times. The United States has hosted the Games four times, more than any other country. Several countries including Italy, Japan, Austria and Norway have hosted the Games twice.  Now in 2010, It is being held in Vancouver, British Columbia Canada. This will be the second time the Games will be held in Canada.The Games will then be hosted by Sochi, Russia in 2014. This will be the first time that Russia has hosted a Winter Olympic Games.

Waterway Tips #1 - Special Lock Fees?This is the first in a series of quick tips and insights when cruising on the Trent Severn Waterway.   This time, we answer the question of whether there are special, or additional fees to use the lift locks (located at Kirkfield and Peterborough) or the Big Chute Marine Railway. Short answer is no, as the fees to use the lock system is charged by the foot per vessel for a specified period of time (daily, weekly or annually) and is not specific to any one lock.   Please follow along on my Channel for more of these Tips, as well as hundreds of original Boating and Travel videos.   The Trent Severn Waterway is located in Ontario, Canada. It's 240 mile/386 km long series of lakes, rivers and canals connect Lake Ontario at Trenton with Georgian Bay/Lake Huron at Port Severn and forms an integral part of America's Great Loop.

Lac La Croix, Warrior Hill, the Nina-Moose River, Rebecca Falls and moreA collection of videos and pictures of the beautiful things to be seen on both sides of the border on Lac La Croix, Agnes Lake, Nina-Moose Lake and River, and the other lakes and rivers in the Boundary Waters (Minnesota) and Quetico Provincial Park (Ontario). I took these pictures and videos on three separate October trips through the same chain of lakes.  I would put in on the Nina-Moose River, go up to Agnes, then Lac La Croix, then east into Iron Lake and Rebeca Falls.  October is the best time to go. No bugs, not many people, the light is a different shade and very beautiful, leaves are turning colors, and it's free after October 1st!

French River Canoe Triphttp://frontierbushcraft.com/expeditions/canoe-canada-french-river/ The Frontier Bushcraft French River canoeing expedition is an accessible, enjoyable and enabling Canadian canoe adventure trip. Here you can hone and integrate your bushcraft and expedition canoeing skills in a superb area of wild Ontario with a colossal canoe heritage, all under the guidance of experts in their field - Ray Goodwin and Paul Kirtley. This expedition provides fantastic opportunity to follow the paddles and portages of natives, explorers and voyageurs on a Canadian Heritage River.   The French River is one of the most important waterways in the history of Canada. A travel route of the Ojibwa Indians, the French River later became a key link in the fur trade. For this alone the French River would be remarkable. However, not only does the French River have an exceptional cultural history, it also possesses a rich natural diversity along with complex topography.  Located in south-central Ontario, the 110 km corridor of the French River drains the region of the Canadian Shield between Lake Nipissing in the east and Georgian Bay in the west. The French River flows through a landscape that remains largely as it was when the first Europeans explored it over three hundred years ago. The area provides great opportunities for employing canoe and bushcraft skills. Indeed, in this environment, they fit together perfectly.

Hammock Camping - 3 nights in Kawartha HighlandsHere are the trip pictures: http://imgur.com/a/oLVaI  The lakes are Algonquin Provincial Park were still not iced-out by the end of may, so some friends and I went portaging at Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park (7 friends total). We started at Long Lake Lodge, where we rented canoes, and then headed west to Cox lake where we stayed for 3 nights.  I didn't go into my setup in the video, but here it is. I switched it up this time and went back to my first hammock - my Eno Doublenest with Whoopies. I used my HammockGear Burrow 40 (with 2oz overfill, all in the footbox), Warbonnet 3-Season Yeti, a Thermarest ZLite foam pad cut-to-size to cover the back of my legs and feet, and the Warbonnet Mambajamba. I'm 6'2'', so I need a decent sized pad to cover my legs since the torso-length UQ doesn't cover past my butt.  The only reason I brought 4 coffee crisp was to make all of the non-Canadians jealous - especially you, Shug :P  Hope you enjoy the video,  YellowRain  ----- This whole video was shot using the Samsung Galaxy S5 in (HDR Video with Smooth Motion 60fps).

#678 A Day in the Canyons 1 CN Martel  2016-09-24I had a very enjoyable day of looking for trains in the Thompson River Canyon and the Fraser River Canyon with Nick. We had some success.  Our first stop was not technically in the Thompson River Canyon, but close enough. CN Martel is just north of Spences Bridge at mile 68.4 of Canadian National's  Ashcroft Subdivision.  For the scoop on train numbers and locomotives, checkout https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV1b4LEYboM It's a good video with alternate views at the same locations by Nick (SD70ACEguy)   If you go to Google, select Maps and paste in  50.49390 -121.29410  you'll see the general location of this video.  Recorded with a Canon XA10 and a Sony HDR-CX110, . Edited and produced using Cyberlink PowerDirector 14 Ultra.   Information regarding locomotive types, build and other data are from the  '2015 Canadian Trackside Guide' published by (and available from) the Bytown Railway Society Inc., Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.  N.B.The photographer and cameras did not encroach on the line of the right-of-way in taking this video. It is dangerous, foolhardy (and illegal) to enter on railway right-of-way. Just sayin' ...

Bull Moose Slurpee Breakfast - Kananaskis, Alberta, Canada.Young bull moose in Peter Lougheed Provincial Park, Kananaskis Country, last fall. We had pulled over as this guy came down the hill on the opposite side of the road, expecting he would walk across the road a little way in front of our car. But instead, he walked towards us and stopped in this little pool right across from our car. He had a good ol' drink and nosh and then crossed the road behind us and wandered off into a meadow.

Boat Cruise Bobcaygeon To Lakefield - Hot & SunnyAnother very hot & sunny day for cruising on the water. Today we are heading along Ontario Canada's 240 mile long Trent Severn Waterway, heading from Bobcaygeon, across Pigeon Lake, through Buckhorn, Lovesick Lake, Stoney Lake and on to our stop for the next couple of days - the village of Lakefield on Lake Katchewanooka.   After a seven hour boat ride on this humid day, it sure was nice to jump in the water fro a refreshing swim. Afterward, a BBQ on the dock with my lovely Anchor Girl set us up for a gorgeous evening, watching the slowly setting sun over Lakefield Marina.   Awesome!

Old Welland CanalThe third Welland Canal took a more direct path from Port Dalhousie to Allanburg leaving behind the Twelve Mile Creek route. From Allanburg the canal continued to follow the previous path with the exception of bypassing many of the canal downtown community centers. Construction on the canal was completed in 1887. The third canal no longer depended on the feeder canal for its source of water. Instead water was directly supplied from lake Erie via the canal itself. The canal was now 4.3 meters deep and its 26 stone locks had swelled to a dimension of 13.7 meters in width with a distance of 82.3 meters between lock gates.

Bergeron Falls in the Winter - Tumbler Ridge, British ColumbiaWelcome to the Tumbler Ridge Global Geopark! At 100 m (328 ft), this is one of the highest known waterfalls in Northern British Columbia, and one of the closest to Tumbler Ridge. Set in a natural amphitheatre, water plunges off Bergeron Mountain and down into the Murray River Valley. You can hike in along a 4.5 km (2.8 mi) trail (one way) that climbs up and down along a series of ridges, finally depositing you at a viewpoint above the falls. For an ever-changing perspective, make your way back and forth along the edge of the bowl in which the falls are set.

Green Lake (Whistler)Green Lake is the largest and most northerly lake in the Resort Municipality of Whistler, British Columbia, Canada. It is the source of the Green River, a tributary of the Lillooet River, and is fed by the River of Golden Dreams, which issues from Alta Lake, which is at the height of land dividing the Green River drainage from that of the Cheakamus River to the south, which is a tributary of the Squamish River. Also feeding Green Lake are Fitzsimmons Creek, which originates in the valley above Whistler Village between Blackcomb and Whistler Mountains, and Rainbow Creek, which descends from Rainbow Mountain via the Alpine Meadows subdivision. A former minor ski hill, Rainbow , is located midway between Alpine Meadows and Emerald Estates near the lake's western extremity.  The Whistler neighbourhoods of Alpine Meadows and Emerald Estates are located on the lake's southwestern and northwestern shores, respectively. The ghost town of Parkhurst (aka Green River, though that is a rail stop at the outlet of Green Lake about 1km north), known locally but incorrectly as Soo Valley (the Soo Valley is nearby but in a different drainage), was based around a lumber mill on a point on the east shore of the lake at its narrowest point, opposite Emerald Estates; the porch of the old main building was the location of a locally famous group nude photo by squatter residents of the area in the 1970s, many of them now figures in the Whistler establishment.  Green Lake is 633 m in elevation and is approximately 1.2 km in length and averages about 650 m in width with an area in the range of 2.2 km².  Green Lake also serves as Whistler Airport (airport code YWS), a waterdrome. Description
PEYTO LAKE, Banff National Park, Canadian Rockies, Alberta, CanadaPeyto Lake is located in Banff National Park near Bow Summit approximately 38Km north of Lake Louise on the Icefields Parkway.  The lake itself is easily accessed from the Icefields Parkway. It was named for Bill Peyto, an early trail guide and trapper in the Banff area.  Glacial lakes have that beautiful turquoise color due to fine grained glacial silt suspended in the water. The silt tends to refract the blue-green spectra of the sun's white light.

Northern Gannet, Cape Saint Mary's Ecological Reserve, Newfoundland and Labrador, CanadaCape St. Mary's Ecological Reserve (known as "the Cape") is one of Newfoundland and Labrador's major seabird colonies. During the breeding season, it's home to a large colony of Northern gannets (approximately 24,000).   I've visited "the Cape" often with my still and/or my video camera, and what draws me back is the easy walking access to view these spectacular birds as close as ten meters away. Bird Rock is reached by a one-kilometer path, through grass and wildflower meadows that top steep cliffs.  Most of the gannet colony make their nests on "Bird Rock"— a tall sandstone stack that is separated from the viewing area by a chasm only a few meters wide. The gannets' courtship, nesting, and feeding behaviors are easily observed from the natural, cliff-top viewing area.  The visitor center is a much-needed addition to "the Cape". This footage was captured in July of 2008.
On the Coastal Trail of Pukaskwa National ParkDave and Deb of ThePlanetD hike the epic Pukaskwa Coastal Trail ---------- Subscribe for adventure! http://bitly.com/1NL1tD7  --------- The Pukaskwa Coastal Hike is one of the toughest hikes in Canada but also one of the most beautiful. Trekking along the coast of Lake Superior is a trip you will never forget. Outstanding views, tough challenges, beautiful scenery and an amazing time. We spent 7 days in Pukaskwa National Park and here are the highlights of our time camping and hiking along one of Canada's most famous and remote trails. Guiding by http://www.naturallysuperior.com  In partnership with http://www.ontariotravel.net http://outdoorontario.com  ThePlanetD Social Channels FACEBOOK: http://www.facebook.com/ThePlanetD TWITTER: http://twitter.com/theplanetd INSTAGRAM: http://instagram.com/theplanetd THE BLOG: http://theplanetd.com/ Music by youtube audio library If you like our adventures why not share them with your friends or family For more adventures visit ThePlanetD.com http://theplanetd.com/ ------------- Video Transcript Woah, Nice Dave Take your Time,  We're good to go My favourite part of the Pukaskwa Hike, would have to be any of the coastal sections I think that was really, I can't really define it into one section, but I really enjoyed scrambling over the boulders, taking in those beautiful views of Lake Superior.  And also, the challenge of it as well, you know it's a challenge to sort of navigate all these slick boulders, with a pack on.  So the challenge, combined with the beautiful views, and the stunning landscape really made it the perfect thing for me.  Hiking the Pukaskwa Coastal Trail, here in Canada, is one of the top experiences of Trekking, that Dave and I have ever had.   It was really fun being with our guide Brenden. He really took care of us. He just made it easier and a lot more fun. He was always keeping us really occupied during the day, you could tell that he could feel when our energy was getting low.  So we'd start playing games with us, and stuff to keep our mind off of the pain in our feet.  And it was just a really good time to really see what you're made of and the challenges of being out there, not showering for 7 days, sleeping in the rain, and putting up your tent and carrying your pack.  It's really one of the toughest things that I've done but also the most rewarding.  And honestly, one of the best times I've had out in nature.  I don't know if this is foot therapy or foot torture.  Favourite part of the Pukaskwa Trail, would probably have to be each night when we'd get to camp, finish making dinner, cleaning everything up.  We'd have half an hour to an hour we were pretty early to bed.  Of just sitting there whether it was taking some pictures of the sunset, or just kind of relaxing, winding down for the night.  I really enjoyed that time with the exception of one night, every night was a beautiful evening.  That was definitely my favourite section.  I had a few favourite parts of the Pukaskwa Coastal Trail. I really enjoyed, walking inland through the forest, I loved the mossy section, I loved the trails, but I also really loved going on the coastal trail and being really high on the cliffs, and overlooking Lake Superior.  It was pretty spectacular.  Yeah Well, we had to sign into the guest book that we were here.  Dave, Deb and Brenden, Ontario Canada. North Swallow out to Haddie Cove.  We made it, we did it!  So if you get a chance to hike the Pukaskwa Trail here in Ontario Canada, do it! Might be a bit of a rough boat ride today.

#626 ThrowBack Thursday CN Kitsumkalum 1976  2015-11- 26I've been posting an occasional ThrowBack Thursday photo to a Facebook page to which I belong. This time I'm throwing in a short video. The quality is terrible, as the original video (and camera) were also terrible. When I got this film back from the developer (in 1976) I realised I was wasting my money on film!  The subject is following a short Extra movement to get ballast from the KitsumKalum Pit, west of Terrace, BC. The caboose is necessary because the move is beyond the yard limits at Terrace.  If you go to Google, select Maps and paste in 54.52995 -128.65980 you'll see the exact location of this video.  Recorded with a Bell and Howell 8mm film camera of dubious heritage. Edited and produced using Cyberlink PowerDirector 14 Ultra.

Port Huron Float Down 2014 - REAL USA Ep. 112 reloadedThe Port Huron Float Down has been happening every third Sunday in August on the St. Clair River in Port Huron, Michigan for decades! Some claim it started in the 1970's and others say it began back in the 1960's. Whatever the case, it has taken on a life of its own from the days when a few people got together and floated down the river before summer came to an end. Today the Port Huron Float Down is a huge event that attracts somewhere on the order of 100,000 visitors to the city both as participants and spectators. Even our Canadian neighbors in Sarnia, Ontario came out to watch the vast parade of people willing to brave the cold water and rapid current.

Caretakers take care of the place, mow lawns, etc. There was underground electrical, apartment buildings, everything a town had. It still has. When I come to the end, all those foundations were houses that were airlifted out. The "Manager's House" was the driveway we pulled into.. Imagine waking up to that view..wow..  Kitsault is an abandoned town in Northern British Columbia, Canada. Owned by a single person, it has been closed to the public for years, for more information, please check out: http://www.kitsault.com/about_hist.html for history

On the Onakawana & Moose Rivers 1978By rail and canoe to tidewater at Moosonee.  A 1978 journey from Cochrane to Otter Rapids on the Abitibi River, a portage through the forest the Onakawna River, and then downstream towards the Abitibi. There were so many meanders, beaver dams, walks and fallen trees on the Onakawana that time ran out.  The train was picked up close to the Abitibi confluence and taken as far as the wide, open and relatively insect free Moose River.  There were no scheduled stations between Cochrane and Moosonee, so you just flag down the train.
Road Trip to Killaloe (002)Julie and I drive from our home in London, Ontario to Killaloe to visit her family at their cottage on the Bonnechere River near Golden Lake. We make stops at Canon in Toronto, as well as Peterborough, and the famous Wilno Tavern.  Thanks for watching, please like, comment, & subscribe.   Follow me: Twitter: https://twitter.com/GeraldUndone Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/GeraldUndone/ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/GeraldUndone/   Gear I used to make this video: My Camera: http://amzn.to/2efaFBU My Lens: http://amzn.to/2effPxK My Studio Mic: http://amzn.to/2efaNRW My Run & Gun Video Mic: http://amzn.to/2ddvalA Tripod: http://amzn.to/2fx2xmn Head: http://amzn.to/2fjijfB Audio Interface: http://amzn.to/2fwXGla Headphones: http://amzn.to/2fjghMG   Synopsis:  The video opens on a packing montage as Julie and Gerald prepare for their weekend in Killaloe.   Their first stop is at Canon in Mississauga to repair the focusing screen on the 5D Mark III.  After hitting traffic in Toronto, they eventually make it to Peterborough where they visit Julie’s friend, Sarah.  The next stop is in Wilno to get some food. They eat the famous perogies of the Wilno Tavern, before going to the lookout.  They make a pit stop in Killaloe to drop some stuff off at Julie’s parent’s house then head to the cottage on Bonnechere River.  The rest of the night is spent setting up the tent, avoiding mosquitos, and applying AfterBite.  The weekend is then spent boating on the river, swimming, exploring the woods, photographing wildlife, and spending time with family.  On Sunday, a flash rain storm ruined their tent packing plans, and forced Julie and Gerald to dry out all their gear.  They eventually got back on the road for the long journey home.   About Me:  Hi! I’m Gerald. Welcome to my channel. Thanks for taking the time to watch this video. I have many other videos on my channel that range in content, including: comedy sketches, gaming videos, DIYs with a unique twist, funny unboxings, passionate reviews, gear talk, rants, life hacks, and even my attempt at an artistic vlog.   I am from London, Ontario, Canada, and have lived in that area most of my life, including West Lorne where I grew up, and a brief stay in Toronto.  I’ve always been passionate about video and filmmaking. When I was younger I was fascinated with my father’s video cameras. He was big into electronics and loved to make home movies, so he was always fussing around with the latest and greatest in consumer camera equipment. I used every excuse I could in school to make my class assignments into videos to allow me to break out the camera and show off my quirky sense of humour. Sadly, after high school, I hung up my amateur filmmaker hat and switched to writing. I’ve been a semi-professional writer and blogger for nearly 10 years and have had several successes.  In 2013, I started running a photography business with my fiancée, Julie. We started out as sports photographers, but now Julie Whelan Photography has moved into active lifestyle and outdoor adventure photography, while not completely abandoning the action sports side. This has given me the resources, gear, and inspiration to finally give YouTube a try.   I hope that my passion for filmmaking, my skills as a writer, and my experience with photography will allow me to create some unique, innovative, and entertaining videos for the YouTube community. So, please subscribe to my channel, and let’s give this a shot together.   Why Undone?  The idea behind the ‘Undone’ part of Gerald Undone is simple. I just entered into my 30s when I started this channel and had been noticing that as I got older I started to take things way more seriously than I ever did before. As a kid I was the class clown type, constantly looking to entertain. As I aged, I found less and less time for silliness and fun. As with most things, it’s easier to notice faults in others than it is in yourself, and it wasn’t until I started to get annoyed at how seriously my peers (now also in their 30s) were taking life that I wanted to change.   The second component is my lifelong problem of feeling like I don’t quite fit in. I often don’t understand the motivations of my peers, and save for my close friends, I don’t think that my peers comprehend mine. As I got older, this divide grew instead of shrank, and I found myself faking it most of the time to try and relate.  So, ‘Undone’ suggests that the pressures of trying to fit into society have been slowly pulling the thread on this serious persona I’ve created for myself. That the years of faking it have finally pulled this façade apart. Now I’ve returned to my most honest, goofy, and albeit borderline insane by conventional standards self. The unfunny, serious, adult me has come unfastened. I have come undone.

Sea To Sky Gondola In Squamish, BC! Easy hikes, great view.Hey everyone!  Part 2 of my birthday celebration I head to the Sea to Sky Gondola in Squamish, BC. The weather was gorgeous and the crowd wasn't too big, but I wouldn't count on having the same luck during full on summer months!   It costs $37.95 for an adult ticket, and although I do find it a little pricey, it's been a long time since I've gotten in touch with nature and the short hikes with gorgeous views for little effort was up my alley.   The Sky Pilot Suspension Bridge was also super fun to walk, just a little rocky to give me the sense of danger I'm looking for.   For more information on the Sea to Sky Gondola, here's a link to their website: https://www.seatoskygondola.com  To check out Timberwolf where I had brunch, here's their website: http://www.timberwolfrestaurant.ca  For my derpy commentary, watch the rest of the video.
